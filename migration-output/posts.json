    "content": "Is Royalti.io the ChatGPT of Music Royalty and Accounting?\n\nMore often than not, young and new music artists want all but the hassle of figuring out the calculations worked into every dollar earned through their music. They want to sing, they want the attention of their manager and label boss, and, of course, that of the fans. They are creatively and enthusiastically thinking of ways to hit top trends on platforms and remain there. Online and offline gimmicks, studio time, parties, shopping and controversies, take a big chunk of their time. How then can they work out the trickles from several streaming platforms and others, and then work in the bits that accrue to the label, publishers, copyright owners, song writers and, finally, their cut?\n\nThe answer lies with Royalti.io\n\nLike ChatGPT, there is an all-in-one solution that helps monitor artists' financial growth/earnings with a click. Ok, maybe two. Royalti.io is to a music artist what ChatGPT is to a researcher.\n\nWith ChatGPT, a researcher could ask anything they need in order to do a project efficiently. From getting broad views and summaries on the subject area, to linking up direct sources of information and referencing, you’re well catered for here. In the same way, an artiste can log into the Royalti platform to view the revenues accrued from all streaming and download platforms according to an agreed sharing formula between the record label and the artiste. All these presented in easy-to-digest forms using an efficient split sheet visualisation technique. Labels can use the Royalti.io platform just as much.\n\nAn artist doesn’t have to be confused about how much they’re making from digital service providers (DSPs), live shows and more. The Royalti platform makes data easily presentable on his dashboard. Music distributors can use the<a href=\"http://royalti.io/\"> Royalti.io</a> platform as well with all their artists onboard and enjoy the ease of quick feedback.\n\nIn case I am yet to spell it out, the platform enables users to string together multiple streams of income with varying percentages of royalties for different stakeholders.\n\n<em>In a nutshell, Royalti.io is an all-in-one platform that simplifies the management of catalogue, contracts, royalty and accounting, for modern recording artists and music companies.</em>\n\nYou can try out a demo of the product<a href=\"https://royalti.io/demo/\"> here</a>",

From songwriting and producing to marketing and distribution, there are a lot of people who need to be on the same page for a song or album to be a success.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One of the most important aspects of the music industry is the split sheet. A split sheet is a document that outlines the financial and creative contributions of each party involved in a collaborative project, such as a song or music video. The document is used to ensure that everyone involved in the project is fairly compensated for their work.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The split sheet will list all contributing members, as well as the percentage of the song or video they are credited with. It will also list the profits and losses for each party, as well as who is responsible for what expenses.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>What Is a Collaboration Agreement?</b>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A collaboration agreement is a contract between two or more artists that outlines the terms and conditions of their collaboration. This document can be used to define things like the division of royalties, who will own the copyright to the music, and who will be responsible for marketing and promotion.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you're in the process of collaborating with another artist, it's important to have a written agreement in place. This will help protect both parties and ensure that everyone is on the same page.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>What Are the Benefits of Using a Split Sheet?</b>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are a few key benefits of using a split sheet when collaborating with other artists.

A split sheet is a document that outlines how royalties will be distributed among the collaborators.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Here's how it works: each collaborator is given a percentage of the total royalties for the song. This percentage is based on their contribution to the song (e.g., writing, singing, producing, etc.). The split sheet should be signed by all collaborators and submitted to the relevant music rights organizations.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>What Are the Benefits of Using a Collaboration Agreement?</b>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When two or more people work together to create a song, it's important to have a written agreement in place that outlines everyone's responsibilities and rights. This is known as a collaboration agreement, and it can be extremely helpful in avoiding any disputes down the road.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>Some of the benefits of using a collaboration agreement include:</b>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">- Clarifying who is responsible for what tasks (e.g., writing, recording, producing)</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">- Determining who owns the song and who gets credit for writing it</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">- Deciding how profits will be split</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">- Avoiding arguments over who contributed what to the song</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">- Protecting each collaborator's rights in case the song is used commercially</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>Why you need to use royalty.io to manage your split sheets, music accounting and royalties</b>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you are a musician or music business owner in Nigeria, it is important to understand the basics of split sheets and collaboration agreements.

    "slug": "the-role-of-royalty-managers-in-a-record-label",
    "content": "If record companies could be likened to cars, then royalty managers are the keys. We all just take for granted that we know where our keys lay and nobody ever bothers to look for them until it is time to leave.\n\nWhen you enter a record label, the last person on your “people I must meet” checklist is the royalty manager. Funny, because when you think about the whole point of a music business, besides the “Joy” of the beautiful art, it is to make money. So who makes sure that the correct credit alert enters the correct bank account without any long story? It is the Royalty manager.\n<h2>Who are royalty managers?</h2>\nA royalty manager, well… manages royalties. In a record label or music distribution company, the royalty manager is in charge of collecting, calculating shares and keeping records of royalties accruable. These royalties are then paid to the owner or contributors to a musical work.\n\nIt sounds like a simple enough job until you realize that they are tracking royalty data accruing from multiple sources, keeping accurate accounting records of all these royalties, and also responsible for sharing said royalties amongst every single contributor or royalty rights holder from that particular body of work based on pre-agreed splits.\n<h2>The royalty manager's skill set.</h2>\nIf the definition of a royalty manager's role sounds like a whole lot of mathematics, it is and a little more. Royalty manager’s duties are not mysteries to be unravelled but it is quite complex and delicate.  Skills required for the position include:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Contracts/terms and splits sheets creation/analyses</li>\n \t<li>Intermediate to Advanced Spreadsheet skills</li>\n \t<li>Mathematical/Analytical skills</li>\n \t<li>SQL or Data visualization for advanced managers</li>\n \t<li>Reconciliation/record-keeping skills</li>\n</ul>\nThat is a lot for one to have on his plate.\n\nLuckily, companies like <strong>Royalti.io</strong> have solutions that make it easier to run a music business and help them keep accurate records of their financial operations. They have services that offer a seamless solution to catalogue management and royalty accounting. It is perfect for tracking, analyzing, and recording royalty data plus contributors can view accruing royalties in real-time.\n\n<a href=\"https://royalti.io/sign-up/\"><strong>Sign up for </strong><em><strong>FREE</strong></em></a>, or <strong><a href=\"https://royalti.io/contact-us/\">reach out</a></strong> to learn more about how we can help you.

    "content": "Collaborating on music is a beautiful thing. Producers, artists, and/or songwriters come together to create magic. The successful creation of a collaborative work requires conversations amongst contributors. What is each person's expected contribution to the work? What credits would be given for each measure of contribution? How would the generated royalty from this work be distributed amongst each contributor?\n<h2>Split sheets: what are they?</h2>\nIn every business agreement terms are negotiated, roles are determined, and expected benefits are specified. A split sheet is one of the documents that represents the fine details of a collaboration. Particularly as it concerns who contributed what and who gets paid what.\n\nRemember, last week we talked about <a href=\"https://royalti.io/2022/04/the-role-of-royalty-managers-in-a-record-label/\">the duties of a royalty manager</a>. They interpret the contents of documents such as split sheets and determine the royalty share each contributor receives based on pre-agreed splits.\n\nSplit sheets are necessary in any collaboration. It sets the foundation of the agreement and protects the contributor's interest. It is a good place to start to avoid legal disputes or “stories that touch” which usually come up after a piece of work becomes successful.\n<h2>What does a split sheet look like</h2>\nA typical split-sheet document would specify\n<ul>\n \t<li>The name of the composition or recording.</li>\n \t<li>Details of each contributor’s personal information (names, contact, and publishing information).</li>\n \t<li>Their role or contribution to the particular body of work.</li>\n \t<li>The ownership percentage of each contributor. Royalties from the work are shared based on these splits.</li>\n</ul>\nIf you have read this piece to this point, congratulations. You now know what split sheets are and why they are so important. However, ensure that the document is signed by all contributors though, e get why.\n\nFinally, Royalti.io offers a simple and transparent system for recording split sheet contracts and automatically calculating royalty shares for each contributor added to a musical work. As a record label, distributor, or artiste, the platform allows you to\n<ul>\n \t<li>combine Royalty data files from different DSPs and distros into a simple dashboard.</li>\n \t<li>Manage royalty shares and payments based on pre-agreed splits.</li>\n \t<li>Grant contributors full or managed access to view their accrued royalties calculated from Splits formulae.</li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"https://royalti.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/screenshot-demo.royalti.io-2022.04.23-18_45_05.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-54566\" src=\"https://royalti.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/screenshot-demo.royalti.io-2022.04.23-18_45_05.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"904\" height=\"415\" /></a>\n\n<a href=\"https://royalti.io/sign-up/\">Sign up for FREE</a>, or<a href=\"https://royalti.io/contact-us/\"> reach out</a> to learn more about how we can help you.

There are some other things we will announce soon too.\n<h3>Multi-user access for Labels and Distros</h3>\nThis one is big both for us and one of our target customer bases. It's also one of the main reasons for starting this platform: Advancing <em>transparency in the music industry</em>.\n\nYou can now create <strong>user accounts</strong> for your rightsholders, including artistes, featured artistes, producers, et al; and grant them access to their royalty shares (splits).\n\nWhile this may mostly be useful for Record Labels, Digital Distributors/Aggregators (of any size), Artiste managers; it can also be very useful for Artistes and music Producers who need to share royalty data and/or revenue with other rightsholders.\n<h3>Royalty Filters</h3>\nThe Royalty page now has an easy to use filtering form, so you can drill down royalty data to specific artistes, releases or tracks. Next up will be filtering for specific DSPs and Territories. Check it out <a href=\"https://demo.royalti.io/royalty/\">here</a>.\n<h2><a href=\"https://royalti.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Royalti.io-Screenshot-Royalty-Filter.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-55567 size-full\" src=\"https://royalti.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Royalti.io-Screenshot-Royalty-Filter.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1002\" height=\"689\" /></a></h2>\n<h3>Accounting</h3>\nWe've added the first version of the <strong>accounting</strong> feature. You can now record payments made to your rightsholders, including artistes, featured artistes, producers, et al. These payments can be recorded in any currency (with overridable auto fetched FX rates) and will be subtracted from the user's gross to get their current due. Next up: Expenses and Revenue.\n\n<a href=\"https://royalti.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Royalti.io-Screenshot-Payment-form.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-55568 size-full\" src=\"https://royalti.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Royalti.io-Screenshot-Payment-form.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"963\" height=\"890\" /></a>\n<h3>and more...</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>We are updating some terminologies to make it easier to use. More on this later.</li>\n \t<li>We added features for easily bulk importing catalog information from uploaded royalty data, or pre-filled spreadsheet files.</li>\n \t<li>There are a few more cosmetic improvements... as always. 🙃</li>\n</ul>\nWe would love to hear your thoughts, so please use the comments below or <em><strong><a href=\"https://royalti.io/contact-us/\">send us a message</a></strong></em>.

    "content": "<h2>What is automation (in Business or accounting)?</h2>\nAccounting automation software helps to convert most or all of the manual accounting processes so that tasks are completed quickly and efficiently.\n<h2>Why automation for your business?</h2>\nThere are different reasons why you should choose to automate your financial accounts. It illustrates a need to refine the process of managing your financial operations. It demonstrates business growth or a recognized need for expansion. Whatever the case, digitization of financial operations for your businesses is necessary.\n\nAdopting technology in your business accounting requires the elimination of manual processes. This could be done either completely or in part. It is characterized by the use of simpler processes aimed at reducing the incidents of human error in calculation. It provides a better chance of accurate transaction tracking.\n<h2>Benefits of accounts automation for your business</h2>\nThe benefits of account automation are immense.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Financial data is better protected.</li>\n \t<li>Faster payments</li>\n \t<li>Accurate bookkeeping and expense tracking.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accounts Automation in Music Business</h2>\nIn the music business, it is not unusual to find record labels with many artists, and they are always putting out new tracks. These tracks in turn generate incomes from multiple sources. These incomes, also known as royalties, are shared amongst contributors. Multiple artists, multiple royalty streams, multiple contributors, advance payments, and expenses. All these transactions require precise tracking and management.\n\nThe concept of computerized accounting is not new. Accountants have always used tools (spreadsheets and accounting software) to carry out their tasks. Yet, most of these tools require some form of manual data imputation, were not built for the new music industry, and are still subject to human errors.\n<h2>Royalty Accounting Automation on <em>Royalti.io</em></h2>\nRoyalti.io has a user-friendly accounting feature built specifically for the music business. The platform allows you to:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Organize your music company’s financial operations, while keeping every stakeholder on the same page, in real-time</li>\n \t<li>Keep track of advances, expenses, and payments, linked to specific artists, assets, or products</li>\n \t<li>generate monthly account statements for payments, expenses, and revenues</li>\n \t<li>Make business decisions informed by accounting data</li>\n</ul>\nIf your accounting team is still transferring data between Excel files, we recommend switching to <a href=\"https://royalti.io/\"><strong>Royalti.io</strong></a>, there's no reason to waste time entering expense numbers into spreadsheets, as they can with our accounting software.\n\n<a href=\"https://royalti.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Royalti.io-Screenshot-Payment-form.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-55568\" src=\"https://royalti.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Royalti.io-Screenshot-Payment-form.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"963\" height=\"890\" /></a>\n\nKindly <a href=\"https://royalti.io/contact-us/\">reach out</a> to learn more about how you can <a href=\"https://royalti.io/sign-up/\">Sign up for FREE</a>.

    "content": "Wherever bold tweets go, there's a fat chance you would find Burna Boy there, sitting pretty. If there's something we can all agree on, it's that Burna walks the talk! I mean, this is a man who bounced back from losing out on the 2020 Grammy Awards for the Best Global Music Album category, to winning it the very next year. At some point, we just may begin to see that Burna’s statements are not ego on freeway, but sheer belief in self.\n\nBurna Boy, whose real name is Damini Ogulu, does not just strike out and grab accolades, he strikes at personalities as well. Lately, Shatta Wale felt his fangs on his neck. AKA had felt it much earlier back in 2019, and would probably pray never to encounter Burna again. Burna Boy also went hard at South Africans after the despicable xenophobic attacks on Nigerians. That’s Burna, he strikes!\n\nThis is not the first time Burna Boy has published sensational tweets. Among many of such tweets, he's proclaimed himself to be '...<em>THE BEST since Fela Kuti</em>\".\n\nhttps://twitter.com/pulsenigeria247/status/1227717530212618241?s=21&amp;t=GqVOAepgZ48tTWTy9GAuQw\n\nAnother one of Burna Boy's tweets has him claiming to be earning more than a good number of artists in the industry. This tweet serves as a prompt for this investigative piece.\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\"<em>Getting more money from music and shows than all your faves combined. FACTs</em>.\"</p>\nThis piece will analyse the tweet above with a view to obtaining the factual basis from which it was made. While there's no mention of Davido and Wizkid, we can only assume that the only artists to come close to his discography and success are Davido and Wizkid.\n<h2><a href=\"https://royalti.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Dx-lPJmW0AU7Ze0.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-56925\" src=\"https://royalti.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Dx-lPJmW0AU7Ze0.jpg\" alt=\"Davido at the o2\" width=\"356\" height=\"230\" /></a><a href=\"https://royalti.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WIZKID-O2-ARENA.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-56926\" src=\"https://royalti.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/WIZKID-O2-ARENA.jpg\" alt=\"Wizkid at the o2\" width=\"352\" height=\"230\" /></a></h2>\n<h2><a href=\"https://royalti.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/grammy-award-winning-nigerian-singer-burna-boy-put-on-a-stellar-performance-at-new-york-city-s-madison-square-garden-thursday-april-28th.webp\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-56927\" src=\"https://royalti.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/grammy-award-winning-nigerian-singer-burna-boy-put-on-a-stellar-performance-at-new-york-city-s-madison-square-garden-thursday-april-28th.webp\" alt=\"Burna Boy at the Madison Square Garden\" width=\"376\" height=\"230\" /></a></h2>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>Is Burna Boy making more money than other artists (<span style=\"font-size: 21px\">read Davido &amp; Wizkid</span>) in Africa?</h2>\nFirst, a brief inroads into how artists make money.\n\nThere are different ways artists make money.\n<ol>\n \t<li>Music sales / Streaming royalty</li>\n \t<li>Shows / Paid performances</li>\n \t<li>Image Rights</li>\n \t<li>Endorsement</li>\n \t<li>Merchandise sales</li>\n</ol>\nFor our fact-checking analysis, we will stick to numbers from Streaming platforms, and hope it helps furnish us with enough insight.

With <a href=\"http://royalti.io/\"><strong>Royalti.io</strong></a>, artistes and labels can view the revenues accrued from all streaming and download platforms according to an agreed sharing formula between the record label and the artiste. An artist doesn't have to be confused about how much they're making from digital service providers (DSPs), Live shows and more. The Royalti platform makes data easily presentable on his dashboard with one click.

That fact isn’t a fact but the argument will keep raging on regarding who is making the most money from their music business since some other revenue channels for these artists aren't public information. We can only speculate.\n\nWritten by Isaac Newton Akah <em>(18-06-2022)</em>",

    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">During a podcast interview last week, Burna Boy disclosed that his sampling of Toni Braxton's song has him relinquishing 80% of the music proceeds. Since the interview aired, social media has been abuzz with different opinions and think pieces about royalty sharing in the music business, with a lot of speculations about Burna Boy's royalties on the single, 'Last Last'.</span>\n\n<a href=\"https://royalti.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/toni-b.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-57201 \" src=\"https://royalti.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/toni-b-300x251.jpeg\" alt=\"Burna Boy's royalties\" width=\"365\" height=\"305\" /></a><a href=\"https://royalti.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/burna-image.jpeg\"><img class=\"wp-image-57196 size-medium alignleft\" src=\"https://royalti.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/burna-image-208x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Burna Boy's Royalties\" width=\"208\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n<p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">“</span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nateusborne/status/1543917120337203200?s=20&amp;t=U1HQ_qxjxmaxKSsCEXByuw\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That’s one of the most special creative processes....but she is taking 60% of the shit yunno</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">”</span></p>\n\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">60% of What? Royalties?</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mechanical Royalties? Publishing Collection Royalties? Gross profit? Let’s do a POV analysis, shall we?</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Off his new album “Love, Damini”, Burna Boy released his new single ‘Last Last’ and suffice to say, it did the numbers really quickly. Arguably, a majority of Nigerians were not aware of the splits agreement between both parties. Now that we have more details, let’s present our perspective.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What happens when that artiste decides to sample a song from a well-known artist in a country that takes IP Infringements seriously? Royalty shares come into play, big time!</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For his raving single “Last, Last”, Burna Boy sampled Toni Braxton’s 2000 </span><a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=toni+braxton+%E2%80%98He+Wasn%E2%80%99t+Man+Enough%E2%80%99\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">‘He Wasn’t Man Enough’</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. On Twitter, Ghanaian-British music Producer JAE5 affirmed through a quote-tweet that the sample rights agreement for this song was that Braxton got 60%, Atlantic Records 30%, and Burna Boy 10% </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JAE5_/status/1544210839850344449?s=20&amp;t=U1HQ_qxjxmaxKSsCEXByuw\"><b>on the publishing side.</b></a>\n\n<strong><i>[This article is sponsored by Royalti.io, an all-in-one platform that simplifies the management of catalogue, contracts, royalty and accounting, for modern recording artistes and music companies]</i></strong>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">“Burna Boy's Royalties: The Publishing Side”</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Artists have been sampling original pieces for the longest time. While there have been a lot of successful agreements between the original song owners and artists, there have been others that ended in disagreements and big lawsuits. Burna Boy's royalties are well calculated and legally backed, having worked things out with Ms. Braxton's management. However, a few artists have been on the nasty end, with a prestigious list including Diddy, Robin Thicke, Ed Sheeran, and others.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Having sampled Braxton's beat and voice in the song, ‘He Wasn’t Man Enough’, Ms. Braxton and her team are now entitled to publishing royalties for songwriting. This is not to mean that she wrote Burna Boy’s ‘Last Last’. However, what was used from the original song (the beat and the monotonous ‘oh’) is credited in the songwriting category. This is what Burna Boy and his team are allotting 60% of publishing royalties to. Again, what do publishing royalties entail?</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the business of music, publishing is a big deal. There are at least four revenue streams through which publishing is furnished. They are briefly discussed below with a focus on which type of publishing Braxton and her team earn from.</span>\n<h3>Revenue Streams for Publishing</h3>\n<ol>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Print Music Sales</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> - This is not the most viable revenue source in these times. However, whether a PDF lead sheet is sold as a download, a website displaying lyrics, or guitar tablature, music publishers make money from them.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Mechanical Royalties</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> - Recording companies earn through this means for every record sold. This earning is for sound recordings and musical compositions. It could be from vinyl, cassette, CD, digital downloads or streaming platforms. Either way, revenues will accumulate.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Public Performance Royalties</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> - Whenever an artist or anyone performs the song, an agreed amount of revenue is earned and collected by the Performing Rights Organisation. This performance can come in the traditional form, where an audience watches an artist perform. Performances can also be through TV and radio broadcasts, or in non-broadcast forms where the song is used in the background at airports or restaurants. </span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Synchronisation Licence Fee</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> - This is what applies where the song is used in film, TV and ads.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As far as the agreement on Burna Boy's royalties for “Last Last” goes, the royalties for Toni Braxton and her team do not include Mechanical Royalties. While Public Performance Royalties are a part of what Ms Braxton will enjoy, this revenue does not affect Burna Boy. Ms Braxton can only earn 60% of the revenue from the management of the performance venue submitted to the collecting organisation, such as </span><a href=\"https://www.sacem.fr/en\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">SACEM</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, SASEC, </span><a href=\"https://www.ascap.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">ASCAP</span></a>,<span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> etc.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Still a little complicated, isn’t it?</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This is because the business of profit is very sensitive, especially in the music business which thrives on Intellectual Property. The <a href=\"https://royalti.io/\">Royalti.io</a> platform was built to solve complexities like this. <a href=\"https://royalti.io/\">Royalti.io</a> makes royalty calculations, split sheet visualisation and catalogue easy for the Artiste and the Management to access, use and understand.

    "content": "Music is one of the most powerful forms of communication and entertainment in the world. It's so powerful that entire industries have been built around it. But as an artist, it's not enough to just create great music. You also need to protect your creative works and understand the business side of music.\n<h2><b>Music Licensing: What Is It?</b></h2>\nGranting permission to another party to use your copyrighted music in exchange for compensation is the process known as licensing music. There are several ways that your music can be used. Each type of use requires a different type of music license. For example, if you want someone to use your song in a commercial, you'll need a different license than if you want them to use it in a movie. Licensing your music can be a great way to make money from your music while also protecting your copyright. It is important to understand the different types of licenses and how they work so that you can choose the right one for each use.\n\n<b>There are a few key reasons why you should license your music:</b>\n<ol>\n \t<li>\n<h4><b>To get your music out there:</b></h4>\nOne of the main benefits of licensing your music is that it gives you a chance to get your music heard by a wider audience. When you license your music, it gets played on TV shows, movies, commercials, and other platforms where people will hear it.</li>\n \t<li>\n<h4><b>To make money:</b></h4>\nAnother big benefit of licensing your music is that it can help you make money. Royalties from licensing deals can be quite significant and can help boost your income as an artiste.</li>\n \t<li>\n<h4><b>To protect your music:</b></h4>\nLicensing also helps to protect your music copyrights. When you license your music, you're giving the licensee permission to use it in a specific way for a specific period. This can help prevent others from illegally copying and using your music without permission.</li>\n \t<li>\n<h4><b>To build relationships:</b></h4>\nBuilding relationships with various music licensors can also be beneficial for both parties involved. When you license your music, you're building relationships with people who can promote and distribute your music to a wider audience.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><b>What Are the Benefits of Licensing Music that You Own?</b></h2>\n<span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif\">The benefits of licensing music that you put out greatly outweigh any unexpected disadvantages that may arise.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif\">There are several benefits to licensing your music, some of which include:</span>\n<ol>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n<h4><b>Increased exposure and reach:</b></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Licensed music is heard by more people and this means that you're giving more people the opportunity to hear it and potentially fall in love with it. This could lead to more people discovering your music and buying your albums or tracks.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n<h4><b>Financial compensation:</b></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> When someone uses your music, they have to pay royalties to you. This can be a great way to make money from your music and help offset the costs of producing it.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n<h4><b>Protection of your work:</b></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Licensing your music gives you legal protection should anyone try to use it without permission. It also ensures that you maintain control over how your work is used.</span></li>\n</ol>\nFor artists and labels, licensing can be a great way to generate passive income and help expose your music to new audiences.

    "slug": "digital-distribution-in-nigeria",
    "content": "The future of digital music distribution in Nigeria is promising. With so much untapped talent and a flourishing industry, unsigned artists have a lot of opportunities to get their music out there.\n\nAside from artists, there are other actors involved in digital distribution (getting music from its point of creation to where you can hear it online). Record Labels, Digital Distribution Platforms, Independent distributors, Producers, Promoters, Agents, and Publicists all play a role.\n<h2>How does digital music distribution work?</h2>\nInitially, physical music distribution (the process of releasing music on CDs, vinyl, or cassettes) used to be the only way to distribute music in the past. Although still in practice, this traditional method of distribution has become even less relevant, applicable, and applied. More creators have begun to switch to digital platforms due to advancements in technology.\n\nHowever, today, the most popular and easy way to distribute music in Nigeria is through digital distribution. This involves releasing music on streaming services or download platforms.\n\nWith digital platforms, the goal is to get music onto Digital Service Providers (DSPs). Some of these DSPs include Spotify, Apple Music, Boomplay, Tidal, and Amazon Music. Also, User Generated Content sites like Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok are target platforms.\n<h2>Digital Music Distribution Companies</h2>\nThere are various digital distribution services in Nigeria you can use to distribute and promote your music online. We’ll highlight some of them below:\n<h4><a href=\"https://dvppermusicng.com/\"><strong>Dvpper Music</strong></a></h4>\nis a Nigerian distribution company, founded in 2017 by Damilola Akinwunmi. They offer Distribution, Marketing/Promotion, Record label and talent management services.

The company has worked with M.I Abaga, Young Jonn, Candy Bleakz, Toby Sheng and many more.\n<h4><a href=\"https://DIXTRIT.media\"><strong>DIXTRIT.media</strong></a></h4>\nis a digital media distribution and optimization company founded in 2015. They have worked with Mercy Chinwo, Gil Joe, Seriki, RAW, Slowdog, and many more.\n<h4><a href=\"https://starmakersdistro.com/\"><strong>Star Makers Distribution</strong></a></h4>\nfounded by Jacob Monday, helps artists across the continent to promote and market their music. They have worked with several African artists such as Oritse Femi, Jaywon, Terry tha Rapman, and many more.\n\nOther distribution services in Nigeria include Jungle Entertainment Venture, Freeme Digital, Fresible Music, OneRPM, and Africori.\n\nAt the end of the day, a well-oiled wheel has the Record labels playing their part, ensuring that artist’s works are distributed through the right channels. In turn, Digital distribution companies ensure that all works distributed through them are accounted for. That royalties are analyzed accurately and transparently using tech-enabled solutions like <strong>Royalti.io</strong>.\n\nAt <strong><a href=\"http://royalti.io\">Royalti.io</a></strong>, we know that the ability to track music royalties seamlessly is an essential part of music distribution.

    "slug": "artist-managers-who-they-are-and-what-they-do",
    "content": "Whether it is unlimited access to celebrities with backstage passes at concerts, planning tours, or strategizing album releases. The job of artist managers hardly sound like hard work, but it is. If you have ever wondered what that job description looks like, we did some research for you.\n<h2>Who are Artist Managers?</h2>\nThe simplest way to define an artist manager is that they are talent gatekeepers. Managers are the artists' representatives. It could be a single person or a company that offers management services. Whatever the case, the job is to establish, promote and protect the artist's career. Managers ensure that the artist’s work gets noticed and their image continues to appeal to the public.\n<h2>What do Artist Managers do?</h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h4><strong>Identify talent:</strong></h4>\nSome manager/artist relationships start with a manager recognizing talent and offering to guide and nurture said talent. A manager ensures that opportunities which encourage the artist’s career growth are always accessible.</li>\n \t<li>\n<h4><strong>Make great decisions:</strong></h4>\nThe manager pools in the right people, collaborations, and deals. He emphasizes building networks to promote the brand that is the artist. Depending on the specific manager/artist relationship, the manager may be responsible for deciding which offers are worth exploring or which aren’t.</li>\n \t<li>\n<h4><strong>Brand marketing:</strong></h4>\nThe tool of an artist is talent. However, a manager understands that the artist’s image and brand are also important. His role should include maintaining the artist’s appeal to their target audience. A manager understands the need for an artist to remain relevant.</li>\n \t<li>\n<h4><strong>Protect artist interest:</strong></h4>\nBe it the process of negotiating contracts, fixing dates for performances, or approving a media appearance. In every room, a manager is the voice of the artists and will always place their interests first. The role is to protect the talent and nurture and promote it.</li>\n \t<li>\n<h4><strong>Network:</strong></h4>\nIn music, the importance of building the right network is understated. The success of an artist depends on a lot of variables. The most important is the composition of the artist’s team and partnerships. Sometimes, choosing the right collaborations is more important than the music. And it is often the manager's responsibility to evaluate these relationships.</li>\n \t<li>\n<h4><strong>Take care of the little things:</strong></h4>\nDepending on the manager/artist relationship, the stage of the artist’s career, and the size of the artist’s team: the manager could take up more responsibilities if necessary. It could be managing cash flow, making it to appearances on time, or ensuring the general well-being of the artist. The manager might be the interim accountant, chauffeur, or personal assistant.</li>\n</ul>\nPheew! That looks like a lot, so bigger artists usually have multiple duty-specific managers e.g Road/Tour manager, Business manager, Legal manager, etc.\n\nThis a reminder that <strong><a href=\"https://royalti.io/\">https://royati.io/</a></strong> is an all-in-one catalog management and accounting platform for music businesses.

    "title": "The Black Panther Soundtrack: Top Five - Nigerian Edition",
    "slug": "the-black-panther-soundtrack-top-five-nigerian-edition",
    "content": "A few weeks ago, the world received the cinematic gift of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Panther:_Wakanda_Forever\"><em>Black Panther II: Wakanda Forever</em></a>. An anticipated masterpiece that did not disappoint expectations. However, it was Marvel’s selection for the Black Panther soundtrack that had our attention. Filled with Africa’s finest and at the top of that list was Nigeria’s <strong>Tems</strong>, <strong>Burna Boy</strong>, <strong>Rema</strong>, <strong>Ckay</strong>, and <strong>Fireboy</strong> <strong>DML</strong>.\n\nThe world can say what they like about Nigerians, but when it comes to music, we set the bar and smash it each time. This week, we picked our five favorite songs on the Black Panther soundtrack lineup by Nigerian artists. These songs are either performed by or written by a Nigerian. They are in order from 'like' to 'addicted'. We hope you have as much fun reading about them as we had selecting them.\n<h2>5. Coming Back for You - Fireboy DML</h2>\nWe loved the intro and the outro. Fireboy DML sounded great, and he delivered on vocals. We got lost somewhere in the middle, and for 22 seconds, we wondered if it was still the same song. But, as fate would have it, everything was right with the world again, and this song made it to this list. All we are saying is sometimes less is more and vice versa.\n<h2>4. Pantera - Aleman, Rema</h2>\nNo, we don’t speak Spanish. For this Black Panther soundtrack, you probably have to look up the lyrics anyways, so look up the interpretation while you are at it. The bottom line, it is good music. It gives you the feeling that you can slap a soldier and get away with it. We strongly advise against this line of action, though. Catchy, it had us moving our bodies to the beat.\n<h2>3. No Woman, No Cry - Tems</h2>\nTems took our favorite Bob Marley song and made us fall in love again. To say our girl is having such a good year would be an understatement, and we love to see it. We all had this song on repeat when it dropped, don’t lie. The only reason it is not number one is that it is a cover.\n<h2>2. Alone - Burna Boy</h2>\nThere is just something about a Burna song. We won’t go as far as saying he has no bad songs, but he delivers every time. Some have argued that this Black Panther soundtrack was the best among the rest. It's one of those songs you hear in a movie and immediately hop on google to find the name. This song is such an earworm and deserving of our number two spot.\n<h2>1. Lift Me Up - Rihanna (Tems)</h2>\nBefore you say anything about the artist not being Nigerian, kindly check the song credits, then come back, and let’s talk. Tems is making us proud, and her pen pulled “the Rihanna” out of her hiatus. So, you are all welcome. Yes, this masterpiece is our number one, and we are ready to die on this hill. This song has been on repeat enough times to become an addiction. But that's okay because we know we will be safe and sound.\n\nThe Nigerian music industry is a space to watch, an eco-system that we dare call self-sufficient. 2022 has been its best year yet. From Grammy nominations to Marvel soundtracks, and it’s not even over yet.\n\nIf you are a record label, artist, or distribution company, <a href=\"https://royalti.io/\"><strong>Royati.io</strong></a> is an all-in-one catalog management and accounting platform for music businesses.

    "title": "Music Royalties, Blockchain &amp; Regulation: Nigeria’s Investment and Securities Act 2025",
    "slug": "[object Object]",
    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To update Nigeria's capital market rules to match global standards, keep up with changes within this sector in the past 18 years, protect investors better, and make the market more transparent, the Investment and Securities Act of 2025 (ISA) was signed into law in March 2025. It replaces the Investments and Securities Act of 2007. Although the Act is widely hailed as a welcome development for Nigeria’s capital market, our focus today is on how this legislation might redefine the way Nigerian artists earn and diversify their music royalties.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Unfolding Legal Status of Digital Assets in Nigeria</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nigeria’s stance on digital assets has undergone quite a transformation. From the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) issuing warnings about the risks of cryptocurrency use and its potential for illicit use, to an outright ban in 2021, the country seemed to be closing the door on virtual currencies.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, between 2023-2024 there was a  gradual easing of policies with introduced guidelines for Virtual Asset Service Providers. And in 2025, law that expressly recognizes digital assets as securities.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Digital Assets as Securities</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With this new legal status, digital assets—including cryptocurrencies, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and tokenized assets- are now considered securities. This automatically places Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), Digital Asset Operators (DAOPs), and Digital Asset Exchanges under the regulatory scope of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In simple terms, this means platforms involved in </span><a href=\"https://royalti.io/2023/11/how-blockchain-technology-is-redefining-the-future-of-music-royalty-management/\"><b>blockchain</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> technology, crypto exchanges, and NFT marketplaces are now regulated by the SEC. Which may include guidelines for their registration, licensing, and tax reporting. For investors, it ensures greater transparency and legal protection for their digital investments. </span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How the Act Could Impact Music Royalties</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It’s no secret that the process of royalty distribution could be complex, from inefficient collection systems, delayed payments, to poor data tracking, there are quite a few challenges. Accurately monetizing streams, downloads, and usage across platforms can be daunting.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, as we’ve always advocated here, technology is offering ways to fix this. While still in its early stages in Nigeria, other countries have already begun exploring how blockchain can enhance accountability and efficiency in royalty distribution.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Tokenizing Music Assets</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The tokenization of music rights is a concept that involves converting ownership of a song or album into tradable digital tokens, each representing a fractional stake in the asset. These tokens can be bought, sold, and used to automate royalty distribution based on token ownership.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">DJ and producer 3LAU (Justin Blau) founded a company called </span><b>Royal.io</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> (not to be confused with </span><a href=\"http://royalti.io\"><b>Royalti.io</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">) that allowed fans the opportunity to purchase Limited Digital Assets (LDAs) tied to streaming royalties. Other platforms like </span><b>Opolous</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> also champion the idea of tokenized music assets.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Additionally, artists can mint exclusive versions of their songs as NFTs and sell them through blockchain-based platforms like </span><b>Catalog</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">,  where collectors can purchase them. </span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Blockchain Technology for Royalty Data</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The potential of blockchain goes beyond tokenization. It can be used to create a unified royalty database capable of accurately tracking streams and downloads in real time. These developments could diversify music income streams and attract new investors into the music space.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Moving Forward: Expectations and Challenges</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">By giving digital assets legal recognition, the ISA 2025 lays the foundation for broader blockchain adoption in music royalty management in Nigeria. It introduces alternative payment avenues, such as crypto-enabled royalty settlements or trading platforms for music rights.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Since these platforms will be regulated by the SEC, the digital assets market is likely to become more stable and investor-friendly.  This could draw interest from institutional investors interested in exploring music as an asset class.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Challenges </span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While the Act provides a legal foundation, clear enforceable standards for the use of digital assets in royalty systems still need to be developed. There is a need to address how digital asset ownership can coexist with existing copyright laws.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There is also a need for education. Enlightening industry players on the potential of digital assets as the likely future of music rights and the diversification of royalty streams, especially in light of ongoing conversations about the earning disparities between Nigerian artists and their global counterparts.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Additionally, Widespread adoption will only happen if there’s investment in blockchain infrastructure; databases, smart contracts, secure marketplaces, that support these new models.</span>",

    "title": "How Record Labels Make Money",
    "slug": "how-record-labels-make-money",
    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Chances are that you’re familiar with the term \"record deal\", but how well do you understand record labels and record deals? </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Let’s break it down for you.</span>\n<h2><b>Simplifying the Role of Record Labels</b></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Put simply, a record deal is a legal agreement between two parties, the record label and the artist. </span>\n<ol>\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The label agrees to release and promote the artist's music for distribution. This is usually done through digital outlets like iTunes or Spotify. </span></li>\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The artist, in turn, agrees to sign over all or some ownership of their recording rights in <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=perpetuity+meaning&amp;rlz=1C1CHZN_enNG1023NG1024&amp;oq=perpertuity&amp;aqs=chrome.2.69i57j0i10i512j0i10i131i433i512j0i10i512l7.4334j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">perpetuity</a> or in exchange for money upfront.</span></li>\n \t<li>Other terms may include a part or fully funded pre- and post-production budget to be paid by the label.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><b>Record Labels Make Most of Their Money From Music Royalties</b></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Most of the financial and technical support provided by a record label is done based on an existing agreement. Payment comes from </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the artist's different avenues. The most common avenue is <strong>Royalties </strong> (also called \"points\"). This is the money earned every time one of their songs is played, downloaded, or streamed. </span>\n<h3><b>Merchandise and Ticket Sales are an Alternative Revenue Source</b></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In addition to music royalties, record labels also make a killing from merchandise and ticket sales.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For example, if an artist has a successful tour, the label can make tens of thousands of dollars in profits from T-shirts, hats, posters, and other memorabilia that are sold at the shows.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And that's not even mentioning the fact that ticket prices are usually jacked up for concerts to maximize profits for everyone involved.</span>\n<h3><b>Sponsorships and Advertisements</b></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sponsorships can come in many forms, such as product endorsements or event sponsorship. Often, the amount of money a sponsor gives a record label is directly proportional to how much marketing and advertising they desire from the label. Record labels, more often than not, generate income through this avenue as well.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Record labels also get paid to place ads on their websites, social media platforms, and even within their albums. In some cases, the ads are for the record label's products and services, while in other cases, they are for third-party services.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2><b>Record Labels and Their Deal Types</b></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Not all record deals are the same. So, let’s dive into the kinds of deals that exist, shall we?</span>\n<h5><b>360 Deals</b></h5>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With this type of deal, the label has rights to the recorded music and all </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">revenue streams generated by the artist. Some of these streams include touring profits, publishing, endorsements, merchandise, and even book or film adaptations or involvements. </span>\n<h5><b>Traditional Record Deals</b></h5>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Here, the record label has the rights and ownership of the artist’s music for a time period. In turn, the label gives the artist a payment advance. This payment is tied to an agreed royalty <a href=\"https://royalti.io/2022/04/explaining-split-sheets/\">split</a>, connected to each sale. However, this is a huge risk for the label as there is no guarantee that the music made will sell.</span>\n<h5><b>Indie Record Deals</b></h5>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Indie record labels are independent, smaller-sized companies that do not operate in the same capacity as major labels. As such, their financial offerings are usually on the lower end. Indie record deals are usually more favorable to the artist. This is because the artist can earn higher royalties or retain copyright ownership.</span>\n<h5><b>Upstreaming Deals</b></h5>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Upstreaming deals are usually between an indie label and a major company. It constitutes a distribution and production deal activated when the artist achieves a pre-agreed level of success. This is a good deal for the artist because they can grow without the pressure that comes with a major label.</span>\n<h5><b>Label Services Deals</b></h5>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These kinds of deals are offered by regular companies that provide similar services to a traditional label. The difference is that label service deals don’t take over ownership of an artist’s record. The deals mostly cover distribution, promotion, publicity, radio, and social media. Payment is made upfront by the company and recouped by taking a percentage of the artist’s shares.</span>\n<h5><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Production Deals</b> </span></h5>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Other kinds of deals that exist are Production deals. These are characterized by a group of financiers who offer full or part support for the entire production process of an artist’s records, including music videos. </span>\n\n<b>Conclusion</b>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It is important to know that while these are the conventional deals that exist, a deal can be made based on agreeable terms between two parties and may not conform to the traditional terms that are commonplace in the industry at present. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As an up-and-coming artist, it is advisable to employ the services of an entertainment lawyer to assist you in overseeing all dealings accordingly and protect your interests. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Follow us on our socials for more knowledge on royalties.</span>",

    "slug": "music-royalties-all-you-need-to-know",
    "content": "<h2><b>What are Music Royalties?</b></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s a simple universal definition: Music royalties are payments made to the owners of the copyrights (also rights) to a record/song by institutions who request permission to use the record on varying platforms and avenues.</span>\n<h4><b>Let’s tell it like you’re 5, shall we?</b></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first point is when an artist records and releases a song. You should already know that when it comes to recording and releasing a song, it is not only the artist that maintains full rights to the song. All contributors in a record are generally referred to as </span><b>Songwriters, </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">they may include composers, producers, instrumentalists, A&amp;R representative(s), even your gateman sef!</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Royalty percentages (also known as points) are agreed upon using </span><a href=\"https://royalti.io/2022/04/explaining-split-sheets/\"><b>Split Sheets</b></a><b>.</b>\n<h4><b>What Next?</b></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now the Artist and other contributors have released the record and all parties have their agreed points/royalty percentages. After release, depending on the success of the record, institutions begin to use the record. These institutions include streaming platforms (also known as Digital Service Providers) such as Spotify, Apple Music, Boomplay, AudioMack, TV, Radio, Performing Centres, Open Spaces (Bars &amp; Lounges), and the list goes on…</span>\n<h2><b>Payment Processes for Music Royalties</b></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you must have gathered by now, music copyrights entail ownership of a sound recording and/or musical composition. This means that every song has two copyrights: sound recording (also master) and musical composition (lyrics, music).</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>How are royalties collected for each copyright type?</strong> </span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Actual royalty payments to rights owners come in several ways, two of which are primary and linked to the copyright types earlier discussed - </span><em><b>Performance Rights </b></em>and <em><b>Mechanical Rights</b></em>\n\n<b>Performance Rights -</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This is a payment made by Digital Service Providers (DSPs) for</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the permission to play a record in public through the live streaming platform</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Simply put, payment is made because you, a Spotify user, has played Davido’s Stand Strong a million times. These payments are typically made to an intermediary body, one of which is the Copyright Society of Nigeria (COSON). Read more on CMOs </span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CiH7yvutY3u/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=\"><b>here</b></a><b>. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These CMOs collect these payments and pay an agreed percentage to the rights owners.</span>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><i>Following a </i><a href=\"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2022/09/mcsn-wins-as-commission-ends-battle-over-artistes-royalties-collection/\"><i>legal suit won</i></a><i> last year, the Musical Copyright Society of Nigeria (MSCN) is the present body responsible for collecting payments from DSPs on behalf of rights owners.</i></strong></p>\n<b>Mechanical Rights -</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This is payment made by Digital Service Providers (DSPs) for </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the permission to reproduce the record (say from a CD to the Apple Music App), through the process of manufacturing, recording and distributing</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. These payments are made directly to distribution companies and record labels that work directly with the rights owners. The distribution company or record label then pays the rights owners.</span>\n<h3><strong>What's more?</strong></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes, a listener’s choice on a DSP platform such as Spotify may activate these two forms of payments. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, whenever an Apple Music User chooses a song for streaming, Apple pays a (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">public</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) performance rights fee seeing as the listener doesn’t actually own the song. Also, because Apple Music has to have </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reproduced </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the composition of the song on to the App before the listener can play it, then the mechanical rights fee are also triggered.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4><b>Different Types of Music Royalties</b></h4>\n<b>Mechanical Royalties</b>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mechanical royalties allow copyrighted works to be reproduced and distributed physically or digitally. This category includes music downloads, CDs, cassettes, vinyl, and streaming services.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A subset of Mechanical Royalties are also known as </span><b>Streaming Royalties</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This basically outlines the payment of and for digital streams. Labels and their artists work with distributors to put the record on streaming platforms. Payments are made by DSPs to Record Labels or Distributors, who then in turn, pay artists and songwriters.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>Public Performance Royalties</b>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you play music in front of an audience or when your music is played in front of an audience, you receive royalties for the composition. Examples are live performances at concerts, TV and Radio broadcasts, as well as background music in restaurants, shops, bars, and nightclubs.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>Synchronization Royalties</b>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When copyrighted music is combined with visual media, synchronization royalties are generated. Visual media includes video content for TV shows, Commercials, Online Streaming, Video Games, Ads, Movies, and sometimes, audio-only sync. A good example of a sync fee being triggered would be Tems singing No Woman No Cry in the official movie trailer for Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To use copyrighted music in an audiovisual project, a master use license and a sync license are required. The master use license is given by rights owners of the sound recording (which is the actual song).  The sync license is given by rights owners of the composition (which refers to the songwriters).</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>Neighboring Rights and Royalties</b>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep in mind that copyright holders who own the musical composition receive payments for public performances of their works.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, neighboring royalties are paid to the recording companies and/or performing artists who own the copyright to the sound recordings.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, they are considered neighbors to performance rights from a legal standpoint, hence the name \"neighboring rights\". The money is also collected by a third party, such as a CMO, and given to the people who own the rights to the sound recording. However, not all nationalities or performance types are always eligible for royalties. It’s a lot to keep up with, we know 😰.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>Processing Royalties </b>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an artist, you're unsure about which types of royalties you're entitled to, consult with an entertainment Lawyer. It can be difficult to determine what applies to your situation and which steps to take.  Music royalties are generated by the use of various music copyrights. New royalty streams are emerging as the music industry and technology evolve. They protect your intellectual rights, and create new ways to generate revenue.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4><a href=\"https://royalti.io/\">Royalti.io</a> can help you account for your Royalties</h4>\n<strong><a href=\"https://royalti.io/\">Royalti.io</a> </strong>is an all-in-one platform that simplifies the management of catalogue, contracts, royalty and accounting, for modern artistes and music companies.

    "title": "Behind the Asake O2 Academy Brixton Tragedy",
    "slug": "behind-the-asake-o2-academy-brixton-tragedy",
    "content": "The questions regarding the tragedies which occurred at Asake's O2 Academy Brixton concert remain unanswered. At the time of writing this, there have been <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/brixton-o2-academy-venues-licence-suspended-after-two-people-die-following-crowd-crush-12773187\">2 deaths related to the injuries</a> sustained at the crowd crush outside the venue of the concert. Asake has been subject to questioning from traumatized attendees and concerned fans. Since then, he has released a <a href=\"https://www.thenationalnews.com/arts-culture/2022/12/16/four-critical-following-crowd-crush-outside-asake-concert-at-02-academy-brixton/?outputType=amp\">statement</a> expressing his deepest sorrows and intent to discover what led to the disastrous events that night. He claims that he is also waiting for answers from the investigation.  Regular concert-goers might find it hard to understand why the artist does not have immediate reasons for the tragedy that occurred.\n\nIt is important to note that this is not Asake’s first concert that ended badly and caused fan outrage. His show in <a href=\"https://www.qed.ng/asake-blames-show-promoters-for-late-arrival-at-birmingham-concert/\">Birmingham</a> days prior had similar issues. His concert in Baltimore, Maryland, during the American leg of his tour in October had a lot of security risks. It was eventually overrun with fans after the gate was compromised. Asake has implied that organisers and venue managers are the reason for these mishaps.  This article will provide likely explanations for what caused the incident and the role promoters and venue managers have to play in it.\n<h2><strong>Who is a Promoter?</strong></h2>\nA concert promoter is in charge of organising and promoting live music events such as concerts, tours and festivals. They work closely with managers, artists and venue owners to book and schedule performances. They also negotiate contracts, and handle all the logistics and finances concerning the show. This means they are responsible for marketing, advertising and ticket sales. They might outsource these tasks to companies who specialise in them (e.g. ticket sales). Regardless, the promoter is the one who delegates these activities. The artist’s role is to show up and fulfil their performance. However, they can also promote the show to the best of their ability but it is not their responsibility.\n\nWe often see errors in concerts where people show up without tickets or attain fake tickets to enter concerts under false pretences. Sometimes, promoters oversell tickets to generate greater profit which then puts attendees at risk. Before the concert,  Asake put out a warning via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/asakemusik/status/1601938005735899139?s=46&amp;t=fHQWxDgc8YH19pc9nQ71tA\">Twitter</a>, urging fans to not show up without a valid ticket. They did not heed his warning.\n<h2>The O2 Academy Brixton’s Responsibility</h2>\nThe O2 Academy in Brixton apparently has a history of problematic concerts. The venue which has a standing capacity of 4,921 ought to have had tighter security than it did the day of the incident. Their issues with security lapses have been indicated on previous occasions. For example, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/21/asake-concert-crush-what-happened-london-brixton-o2\">Fred Again</a> performance, a week before Asake’s scheduled show, had security issues. Attendees expressed security concerns as they claimed that security let in too many people. Another complaint came sometime in March <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/dec/21/asake-concert-crush-what-happened-london-brixton-o2\">during a Slowthai concert</a>; an attendee claimed to have seen security at the venue taking money from people to be let in.\n\nThese errors in carrying out the proper security measures can put tons at risk. People present during the night of the Brixton crowd crush say they saw the venue fill up before the intended performance time. The O2 Academy Brixton currently has its <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/tv/news/brixton-academy-o2-license-crush-b2250212.html?amp\">licence suspended until January 16th</a> . A proper hearing will take place to decide the site’s ability to hold safe events.\n\n<em>Ahmed ‘Asake’ Ololade</em> is a 27- year old afrobeats artist who shot to new levels of fame this year. His hit songs this year include “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WU__JQuB8g\">Sungba</a>” “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MefXQvGTYtE\">Peace Be Unto You</a>” and “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrIP_igi76U\">Terminator</a>”.\n\nRemember that licensing and royalty arrangements can be complex, as well as  the terms surrounding the agreement.

    "slug": "music-and-money-101-financial-management-and-the-music-business",
    "content": "Financial management is critical for a music business, allowing everyone from record label executives to the artists to track income and expenses, have a finger on whether they are turning a profit, and plan appropriately with data for the future.\n\nIt can be complicated to keep track of the music industry's different financial aspects, such as expenses, royalty payments, and taxes.

The complex nature of rights and royalties, plus the challenge of managing multiple income streams, makes financial management a nightmare for musicians.\n\nThe lack of transparency in the industry, especially in digital music services, makes things even worse. This is where a royalty management platform like Royalti.io comes in handy. By providing a single source of truth for all revenue and expenses, Royalti.io can streamline financial processes and reduce the likelihood of errors.\n\nFor example, Royalti.io helps with music catalogue management, which is essential for keeping track of all the different rights and royalties of musicians and record labels.

Proper financial management can help them achieve their goals and stay ahead of the competition. Artists need to understand their finances so they can make informed decisions and maximize their earning potential.\n\nOne of the most important aspects of financial management in the music industry is royalty management. Artists and record labels receive royalties from a variety of sources, including streaming platforms, radio airplay, and live performances. It's important to keep track of these royalties and account for them accurately to make sure artists are compensated fairly for their work.\n\nAs musicians and record labels release new music, it's also important to keep track of their growing catalog and the revenue generated from each song or album. This helps artists and labels understand which songs are performing well and which ones need more promotion or marketing.\n\nRoyalty accounting solutions, like Royalti.io, can help musicians streamline their financial processes. These platforms automate the collection, calculation, and distribution of royalties, saving artists time and effort.

Effective financial management can help you make informed decisions, allocate resources wisely, and maximize your revenue, whether you're a musician, manager, or part of a record label.\n\nHere are some tips and strategies to optimize financial management in the music industry,\n<h3>Develop a Detailed Budget</h3>\nCreate a comprehensive budget outlining your income sources, expenses, and financial goals. This will give you a clear picture of your financial situation and help you allocate resources effectively.\n<h3>Track Income and Expenses</h3>\nMaintain accurate records of all your income and expenses. Use accounting software or tools specifically designed for the music industry to track royalties, licensing fees, merchandise sales, touring expenses, and other financial transactions. Regularly review and reconcile your financial statements to identify any discrepancies or areas for improvement.\n<h3>Separate Personal and Business Finances</h3>\nIt's essential to keep your personal and business finances separate. Set up a dedicated bank account and credit card for your music-related income and expenses. This separation makes tracking your financial performance easier and ensures you're not mixing personal and professional funds.\n<h3>Monitor Cash Flow</h3>\nCash flow management is vital in the music industry, where income can fluctuate. Track your cash inflows and outflows regularly to identify any potential cash flow gaps. This will help you plan for lean periods and ensure you have sufficient funds to cover your expenses.\n<h3>Negotiate Contracts and Royalty Agreements</h3>\nWhen signing contracts or royalty agreements with record labels, publishers, distributors, or streaming platforms, carefully review and negotiate favourable terms. Understand the revenue share, royalty rates, advance payments, and other financial provisions. Consider consulting with a legal professional or financial advisor experienced in the music industry to ensure you get a fair deal.\n<h3>Diversify Revenue Streams</h3>\nRelying solely on music sales or live performances can be risky. Explore other revenue streams such as merchandise sales, licensing, sync placements, brand partnerships, crowdfunding, and streaming royalties. Diversifying your income sources can provide stability and help you generate revenue even when traditional avenues are slow.\n<h3>Control Expenses</h3>\nKeep a close eye on your expenses and identify areas where you can reduce costs without compromising quality. Look for opportunities to streamline operations, negotiate better deals with suppliers, and optimize your touring and production expenses. Cutting unnecessary costs can significantly impact your bottom line.\n<h2>Get Streamlined Royalty and Catalogue Management</h2>\nLeveraging technology is essential to advance your career in the music industry and stay on top of your game. By streamlining your finances, you can conveniently monitor your cash flow while managing your catalog, contracts, and splits. Interestingly, no platform does it better than <strong><a href=\"https://royalti.io/#\">Royalti.io</a>.</strong>\n\nBy implementing these tips and strategies highlighted in this article, you can optimize financial management in the music industry.

    "slug": "digital-music-rights-a-deeper-dive-into-digital-music-royalties",
    "content": "Music streaming across digital platforms has increased due to the pandemic. People now get entertained through digital media.  This has increased the need for creators to guide their royalties selfishly. Therefore, it is vital to register songs to ensure that metadata is accurate. Both royalties and licensing are crucial factors in the music industry.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In recent years, independent artists have been fond of uploading their content on digital platforms without proper metadata. This has led to the inadequate collection of royalties by CMOs and creators being robbed of credits for their work.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Parties involved in music creation need to ensure that they take special attention when uploading their music by : </span>\n<ol>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Enter only accurate MetaData with required credits to authors and composers with their legal names</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Enter the correct full name/Stage name </span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Enter necessary codes, e.g., ISRC Code, ISWC Code, year of release </span></li>\n</ol>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This makes it easier for CMOs to track and claim assets to collect royalties, which will be passed on to the copyright owners.</span>\n<h2><b>What exactly are CMOS? </b></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">‘CMO’ stands for Collective Management Organization. A CMO organization collects the revenue you are owed for using your songs and is the best way to manage your royalties. As an establishment, a CMO is controlled and regulated by its members. Therefore, it must conduct its business fairly. It also has to be legally authorized in the country it's operating to collect royalties on behalf of its members. The Musical Copyright Society of Nigeria (MCSN) and Copyright Society of Nigeria (COSON) are the only two generally recognized collecting societies in Nigeria. </span>\n<h2><b>Who gets paid music royalties?</b></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As the world tilted toward Digital Music Streaming, parties involved in getting paid music royalties increased.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Three different types of rights are to consider when determining who gets paid music royalties. We've listed some parties involved below: </span>\n<ol>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Music writers: They are responsible for writing a song's music and lyrics. They will be paid mechanical royalties if someone uses their music publicly. They also have the right to receive performance royalties if the music is played on the radio or television. </span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The publisher: They are responsible for ensuring that copyright holders receive their payment for using their songs. They will obtain mechanical copyright to your music in exchange for you receiving royalties. If you are considering a music publisher in the future, they will do this.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Record labels: are responsible for marketing and distributing musicians’ recordings. They will have the master rights to songs but not the publishing rights; however, artists can still receive a portion of their earnings through their work and other revenue streams like merchandise sales.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Performance artists: These are people who perform the songwriter's original work. They will only have publishing rights if they are also the songwriter. Any other public performances of the songwriter's original work will generate some royalty income for only the original owner.  </span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mechanical licensing agencies: They manage mechanical licensing rights for music publishers through their exclusive license to reproduce or distribute music on any medium. They charge a set fee for reproducing or distributing music. The agency makes money from the fees and gives a share back to publishers.  </span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sync licensing agencies: They have exclusive licenses from record labels or publishers to issue licenses regarding syncing music with audiovisual media such as movies or television shows. They tend to take a share of the upfront fees required to license songs. </span></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The landscape of copyright licensing and royalty collection is vast and complex. It’s a common misconception among songwriters that once they’re members of a collection society, they’re fully covered for collecting all their publishing royalties, performance, and mechanical.  This is not true! </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For example, some publishers only pay for mechanicals; others only pay for performance rights; still, others don’t pay anything at all!  So, suppose you are unsure whether your publisher will cover all aspects of your publishing income. In that case, speaking with them directly or checking with your local collecting society before signing up as a member is essential.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Collecting digital royalties can be hard work; you don’t need to think much about it when we are here to help you sort it out. You need to sign up on </span><a href=\"http://royalti.io\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">royalti.io</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to settle contracts, splits, sort royalties, and manage parties involved in your music. </span>\n\n&nbsp;",

So far, there have been several signs that point to the new paradigm that blockchain is ushering in for music royalty management.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For example, in 2018, Grammy-award-winning artist Imogen Heap </span><a href=\"http://myceliaformusic.org/2018/06/20/mycelia-imogen-heaps-blockchain-project-artists-music-rights/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">announced her new project</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, Mycelia, which uses the blockchain to help artists manage and monetize their work. While it's still early days, it's clear that the blockchain is poised to play a significant role in the future of the music industry.</span></p>\n\n<h2><b>How can music royalty management incorporate Blockchain Technology?</b></h2>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Many aspects of the music industry could benefit from blockchain technology. For example, music royalty management could be revolutionized by incorporating blockchain into the system.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Here's how it would work: The blockchain would act as a public ledger, tracking all the royalty payments from songwriters, producers, and performers to record labels, publishers, and streaming services. This would create a more transparent system that would be less open to corruption.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Not only that, but the blockchain could also be used to track ownership of songs and Intellectual Property. This would be a huge benefit for artists often ripped off by unscrupulous record labels and management companies.</span></p>\n\n<h2><b>What are the major stumbling blocks in adopting blockchain technology in managing music royalties?</b></h2>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are a few major stumbling blocks in the adoption of blockchain technology in the music industry.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">First, the issue of who would be responsible for maintaining the blockchain network: the record labels, artists, or a third party? </span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There is also the question of how royalties would be paid out: in Bitcoin or a new cryptocurrency? </span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And finally, there is the fear that blockchain technology could be used to pirate music and deprive artists of their rightful royalties.</span></p>\n\n<h2><b>What Is the Future of Blockchain Technology Music royalty management?</b></h2>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So, what's the future of music royalty management? Some experts believe that blockchain technology could hold the answer.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Blockchain is a distributed database that allows for secure, transparent, and tamper-proof transactions. This makes it the perfect solution for tracking and managing digital assets, such as music royalties. Many prominent music industry players are already investigating how blockchain could be used to improve royalty management processes.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So, the music industry is starting to take notice of blockchain technology. And with its potential for secure, transparent, and efficient transactions, we'll see more blockchain-based solutions in the music industry in the years to come.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Right now, the music industry is at a crossroads. With the advent of new technologies like blockchain, things are changing quickly. As more and more artists move to independent labels and distribution models, it's more important than ever to have a system that accurately tracks and manages royalties.</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That's where </span><a href=\"https://www.royalti.io/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">royalti.io</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> comes in.

    "title": "What Are Music Royalties?",
    "slug": "what-are-music-royalties",
    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Music royalties involve obtaining permission to use music from an individual, which can be songwriters, composers, recording artists, and their respective representatives who have the right to control the use of that music. These rights are primarily derived from copyright law and have different rights related to various aspects of music. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For example, in Nigeria, record companies usually own or control the copyrights in the recording of a song. That means if anyone else wants to use the recording, you need the record company's permission. The law also entitles performers in connection with playing in the recordings.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You can join up with a music publisher as an artiste to market your work for commercial use or a </span><a href=\"https://royalti.io/2022/12/how-record-labels-make-money/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">record label</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Music publishers will look for singers, musicians, and production companies who can help you make your idea into a song.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">By registering with a publisher, you are granting them the rights to your work. They'll be able to issue </span><a href=\"https://royalti.io/2022/07/music-licensing-a-beginners-guide-to-licensing-your-music/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">licenses</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and collect music royalties for you. The royalties are then divided evenly between you and the publisher.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Record labels are involved with financing the creation and distribution of master recordings. As a result, they receive a portion of the royalties paid to record artists.</span>\n<h2><b>Different Types of Music Royalties</b><b></b></h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h3><b>Mechanical Royalties</b></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mechanical royalties allow the reproduction and distribution of copyrighted works physically or digitally. This category includes music downloads, CDs, cassettes, vinyl, and streaming services.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When a record label produces a CD of a songwriter's music, mechanical royalties get paid to them. Alternatively, an independent distributor with a copyright can collect mechanical royalties from a distributed digital music service.</span><b></b>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h3><b>Public Performance Royalties</b></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When you play music in front of an audience or when your music gets played in front of an audience. You receive royalties for the composition (for example, for live performances) or (on TV, Radio, or at DJ events). Live performances at concerts or festivals are prominent examples. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Public performances also include TV and radio broadcasts, as well as background music in restaurants, shops, bars, and nightclubs. You may be eligible for performance royalties due to all of this through your Performance Rights Organization (PRO).</span><b></b>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h3><b>Synchronization Royalties</b></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When there's a combination of copyrighted music with visual media, the generation of synchronization royalties happens. Copyrighted music has been licensed for film, television, commercials, video games, online streaming, advertising, music videos, and other visual media through synchronization licenses.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As distinct as synchronization is from audio and video media, YouTube videos, for example, are not covered by synchronization licenses. A master use license is required before using copyrighted music in a new audiovisual project.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To use protected music in an audiovisual project, a master use license and a sync license are required. The sample is welcome, no matter how long or short it is. To sync YouTube wedding videos with Chike's tracks, a master and sync agreement is required.</span>\n<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Getting paid for your music may be more complex and straightforward, but there are several revenue streams you can pursue. When you release a new song, make sure you get the most out of it by understanding which of the three types of royalties apply to you. It is entirely possible to make a living as a musician with mechanical royalties, performance royalties, and sync royalties.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you need clarification on which types of royalties you're entitled to, you should consult an entertainment lawyer. It can be challenging to determine what applies to your situation and which steps to take. The use of various music copyrights generates music royalties. New royalty streams are emerging as the music industry and technology evolve. That’s why </span><a href=\"https://www.royalti.io/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Royalti.io</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> is also here to help you with adequate resources for making informed royalty-centered decisions.

    "title": "How Does Music Licensing Work?",
    "slug": "how-does-music-licensing-work",
    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When you license your music, you grant the licensee the right to use your song for a specific purpose. This could be for one-time use or an extended period. The terms and conditions of your license agreement should be clearly outlined in the contract, including the royalty rate you will receive.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Typically, when you license your music, you will give the licensee rights to use your song for a specific purpose and a specific duration of time.  No two licensing agreements are the same. Therefore, if you do not wish to license your song to another party for the same usage, you would need to negotiate new terms with the new licensee. The right granted by a licensing agreement could be either exclusive or non-exclusive.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you're not sure where to start when it comes to music licensing, look no further. Our team at Royalti.io would be happy to help!</span>\n<h2><b>What Are the Different Types of Music Licenses?</b></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are a few different types of music licenses:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h4><b>Synchronization license </b></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Here the licensee can synchronize the copyrighted music with visuals, such as in a movie, TV show, or ad.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h4><b>Master use license</b></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This allows the licensee to use the master recording of the copyrighted song.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h4><b>Mechanical license </b></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Allows the licensee to create a physical copy of the copyrighted song, such as a CD or vinyl record.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h4><b>Performance license </b></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This allows the licensee to perform the copyrighted song publicly.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h4><b>Digital performance license </b></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This allows the licensee to perform the copyrighted song digitally.</span>\n<h3><b>How to Get Started With Music Licensing</b></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The first step is to secure the rights to your music. This means you must have the copyright to your song and/or the master recording.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Once you have the rights to your music, you'll need to register with a licensing company. There are several of these companies out there, so do your research and find one that's a good fit for you and your music.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Once you're registered with a licensing company, they'll pitch your music to businesses and organizations interested in using it. If someone likes your track and decides to use it, the licensing company will handle all the paperwork and negotiations for you.</span>\n<h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you're an artist, songwriter, or record label, it's essential to understand the benefits of music licensing. Licensing your music can help you get your music heard by a wider audience and can also help you earn royalties from your music. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are many ways to license your music, and it's essential to choose the right licensing option for your music. </span><a href=\"https://www.royalti.io/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Royalti.io</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> is an all-in-one platform that simplifies the management of catalogue, contracts, royalty, and accounting for modern artists and music companies.

    "slug": "is-royalti-io-the-chatgpt-of-music-royalty-and-accounting",
    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">More often than not, young music artists want all but the hassle of figuring out the calculations worked into every dollar earned through their music.

    "slug": "royalti-io-music-management-platform-everything-you-need-to-know-about-split-sheets-and-collaboration-agreements",
    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When it comes to the music industry, there are a lot of moving parts. From songwriting and producing to marketing and distribution, there are a lot of people who need to be on the same page for a song or album to be a success.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One of the most important aspects of the music industry is the <a href=\"https://royalti.io/2022/04/explaining-split-sheets/\">split sheet</a>. A split sheet is a document that outlines the financial and creative contributions of each party involved in a collaborative project, such as a song or music video. The document is used to ensure that everyone involved in the project is fairly compensated for their work.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The split sheet will list all contributing members, as well as the percentage of the song or video they are credited with. It will also list the profits and losses for each party, as well as who is responsible for what expenses.</span>\n<h2><b>What Is a Collaboration Agreement?</b></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A collaboration agreement is a contract between two or more artists that outlines the terms and conditions of their collaboration. This document can be used to define things like the division of royalties, who will own the copyright to the music, and who will be responsible for marketing and promotion.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you're in the process of collaborating with another artist, it's important to have a written agreement in place. This will help protect both parties and ensure that everyone is on the same page.</span>\n<h3><b>What Are the Benefits of Using a Split Sheet?</b></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are a few key benefits of using a split sheet when collaborating with other artists. Here are a few of the most important ones:</span>\n<ol>\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> It ensures that everyone gets paid fairly.</span></li>\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> It prevents any misunderstandings about who is responsible for what.</span></li>\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> It makes it easier to track who is contributing what to the project.</span></li>\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> It helps to avoid any disputes later on.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<h3><b>How Do I Use a Split Sheet?</b></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you're working with other artists or songwriters on a project, you'll need to create a split sheet to ensure everyone gets paid fairly. A split sheet is a document that outlines how royalties will be distributed among the collaborators.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Here's how it works: each collaborator is given a percentage of the total royalties for the song. This percentage is based on their contribution to the song (e.g., writing, singing, producing, etc.). The split sheet should be signed by all collaborators and submitted to the relevant music rights organizations.</span>\n<h3><b>What Are the Benefits of Using a Collaboration Agreement?</b></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When two or more people work together to create a song, it's important to have a written agreement in place that outlines everyone's responsibilities and rights. This is known as a collaboration agreement, and it can be extremely helpful in avoiding any disputes down the road.</span>\n<h4><b>Some of the benefits of using a collaboration agreement include:</b></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">- Clarifying who is responsible for what tasks (e.g., writing, recording, producing)</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">- Determining who owns the song and who gets credit for writing it</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">- Deciding how profits will be split</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">- Avoiding arguments over who contributed what to the song</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">- Protecting each collaborator's rights in case the song is used commercially</span>\n<h2><b>Why you need to use Royalty.io to manage your split sheets, music accounting, and royalties</b></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you are a musician or music business owner in Nigeria, it is important to understand the basics of split sheets and collaboration agreements.

    "slug": "2023-in-african-music-top-5-defining-moments-in-the-music-industry",
    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There's no doubt that 2023 has proven to be yet another remarkable year for African music. From serving dance floors throughout the continent to home streaming audiences, listening to modern African music is something many people worldwide now consider hip and chic. The music artistes leading the Afrobeats exportation are making headlines for their adventures and setting new records as the genre grows internationally.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As much as there are various myths and misconceptions about Africa, opinions about our music, especially in recent years, have been quite even. African music, especially Nigerian music, gained popularity throughout the world in 2023 as a result of celebrities selling out prestigious venues, taking home accolades from around the world, and shattering chart records. This week, we picked five leading defining music moments made by African artists in 2023. In no particular order, join us as we take you on this exciting journey. </span>\n<h2><b>1. Introduction Of The “Best African Music Performance” Category At The Grammys </b></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In June 2023, The Recording Academy announced the addition of three new categories to include Best African Music Performance. The decision to launch the Best African Music Performance category was made in response to the rising international recognition and chart-topping success of African musicians such as Burna Boy, Wizkid, and Tems. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The inclusion honours the Afrobeats genre's impact while showcasing distinctive regional expressions from all over Africa. The following subgenres will be taken into consideration: Fuji, Ndombolo, Mapouka, Ghanaian drill, Afro-house, South African hip-hop, Afrobeats, Afro-fusion, Afro-pop, Bongo Flava, Ethio jazz, Kizomba, High Life, and Fuji.</span>\n<h2><b>2. Burna Boy London Stadium Concert</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Following his performance at the London Stadium on June 3, 2023, which drew 60,000 fans, Burna Boy made history as the first African artist to headline a stadium concert in the United Kingdom. The singer wowed a sold-out West Ham United London Stadium with a brilliant performance, supported by his band 'The Outsiders'. The stadium can accommodate 80,000 spectators for entertainment events in addition to its 60,000 seats for football games.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fans were treated to a set list that featured up to 49 songs from Burna Boy's impressive hit catalogue. The biggest names in the UK music scene, including Dave &amp; Jhus, Popcaan, and Stormzy, made cameo appearances at the concert. With this enormous stride, Burna Boy cemented his status as a global superstar and demonstrated the swift expansion of Nigerian music across the globe.</span>\n<h2><b>3. Davido’s Timeless Album </b></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Afrobeats fans eagerly awaited Davido's fourth album, \"Timeless,\" which he released on March 31, 2023, after a brief break in 2022. It was arguably the most highly anticipated album in Afrobeats' history. Around all major streaming platforms, the album broke numerous records for African streaming on its first day and week of release.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Timeless went on to bag three 2024 Grammy Awards nominations, including Best Global Album, Best Global Music Performance for his song \"Feel,\" and Best African Performance for his song \"Unavailable.” </span>\n<h2><b>4. Rema’s Calm Down Billboard Strides </b></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"Calm Down,\" by Rema, spearheads the global push for Nigerian music, with remarkable chart performances worldwide. The song has surpassed Wizkid's \"Essence,\" featuring Tems and Justin Bieber's record No. 9 peak, becoming the highest-charting Nigerian song on the Billboard Hot 100. It peaked at No. 3 in the rankings.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">'Calm Down' also became the second-highest charting African song in the Billboard Hot 100 history. It doesn't end here; Rema also made an astounding milestone with Calm Down, reaching one billion streams on Spotify. It didn't come as much surprise when the song won best Afrobeats song at the 2023 MTV Video Music Awards. </span>\n<h2><b>5. Tiwa Savage Coronation Performance</b></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When Tiwa Savage performed alongside other artists at King Charles III's coronation on May 6, 2023, she became the first Nigerian artist to perform at the coronation of an English monarch. Even though her appearance and song selection drew criticism, Tiwa Savage's performance was a huge step forward for Nigerian music and ranked among the best live performances by the country's artists in 2023.</span>\n<h2><b>6. Tyla's Musical Feats</b></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When you hear the phrase, “make me sway,” odds are that you're already humming what comes after. Pop princess Tyla from South Africa went viral with her song \"Water,\" which has become popular worldwide. This song went viral very quickly and became a popular dance challenge on TikTok. Water gained traction and eventually became Spotify's esteemed Top 40 worldwide chart. According to African Folder, Tyla has now become the first South African to reach 10 million monthly listeners on Spotify.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The African music industry is undoubtedly taking the world by storm and rapidly building an eco-system that many would describe as strong, unique and brimming with potential. 2023 has proven that the momentum from previous years will only increase and go all the way up from there. From an independent category made for African music at the Grammy to Africans bagging numerous international awards, the fire is burning brighter by the year.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For distribution companies, record labels, or even music artistes, Royalti.io is a one-stop shop for accounting and catalogue management for music businesses.

    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These days, we continue to see a need for more than just talent and commitment to launch and sustain a successful career in the music business. For many artists, negotiating the commercial side of their job requires an awareness of the nuances of certain elements, such as music contracts.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These contracts, which can be intricate and multidimensional, form the basis for many partnerships in the business, such as those between publishers, record labels, artists, and producers.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Take Nigeria, for example; there have been several cases of up-and-coming musicians eager to become famous and well-known signing recording contracts with little to no understanding of the potential legal repercussions. On the other hand, record labels meticulously craft contractual clauses into agreements to optimize profits. That's why a basic understanding of what music contracts are is essential. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Come with us as we briefly explain music contracts in this guide, along with their various types and importance in today's music industry. Let's get into it.</span>\n<h2><b>What Are Music Contracts? </b></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Music contracts are legally enforceable contracts that specify the terms and circumstances of a business relationship or transaction in the music industry.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">They give artists and business professionals insight and security by outlining each party's rights, obligations, and responsibilities. These contracts also cover aspects of the music industry, such as record releases, royalties, touring, merchandise, and </span><a href=\"https://royalti.io/2022/07/music-licensing-a-beginners-guide-to-licensing-your-music/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">licensing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Music contracts are essential for directing and preserving musicians' and business people's careers. They offer a system of laws that guarantees just recompense, safeguards intellectual property rights, and encourages accountability amongst concerned parties. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For musicians hoping to establish long-term careers in a constantly shifting field, comprehending these agreements' subtleties is becoming increasingly essential as the music industry develops.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, music contracts can be intimidating and complicated, particularly for up-and-coming musicians who might need more industry experience or legal knowledge. </span>\n<h2><b>Must-Know Terms In Music Contracts </b></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It's essential to comprehend the terms and conditions of any music contract you negotiate. In light of that, here are some important things you should know:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h3><b>Royalties</b></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span>The money paid to songwriters, artists, and other parties in exchange for using their music is what <a href=\"https://royalti.io/2023/11/what-are-music-royalties/\">royalties</a> are. When negotiating an equitable split of royalties, it is crucial to comprehend the royalty structure specified in the contract.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h3><b>Advances</b></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span>Advances center around payments given to songwriters or performers in advance of the release of an album or single. It's important to bargain for a reasonable advance that includes expenses for promotion and recording.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h3><b>Ownership</b></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span>Any music deal takes ownership of copyrights into account. It's vital to ascertain who the copyright holder is and to bargain for a reasonable ownership split.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h3><b>Promotion</b></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span>Every music release needs to be promoted to be successful. A promotion budget may need to be negotiated; ensure the contract specifies the promotion strategy in detail.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b>Types Of Music Contracts</b></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Many different types of music contracts address other facets of creating music. These can include contracts for performance, management agreements, publishing, and recording.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h3><b>Recording Contracts </b></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Recording contracts stand among the most prevalent kinds of music contracts. In essence, these are contracts for the recording and release of music that an artist and a record label sign.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As part of this agreement, the label typically pays for the artist's marketing, promotion, and music distribution at every step of the recording process. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In return, the artist commits to providing the label with a set quantity of albums or tracks within a given time. These agreements' provisions frequently cover information about master recording ownership, advances, recoupment, and royalty rates.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h3><b>Publishing Contracts </b></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<b></b><b></b>These agreements are between a music publisher and a songwriter. A publishing arrangement may include giving a publisher complete or partial ownership of copyrights in return for their knowledge of how to market and profit from an artist's catalogue.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Promotion can happen in several ways, like licensing movies, TV shows, advertisements, or other synchronization opportunities. In addition, publishers receive performance royalties (from radio plays and live performances) and mechanical royalties (from physical or digital sales) on behalf of songwriters.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h3><b>Management Contracts </b></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The conditions of the partnership between an artist and a manager are outlined in these contracts. These can include the extent of services provided, the management's duties, the contract's length, and the manager's pay. This payment usually takes the form of a portion of the artist's gross earnings.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h3><b>Performance Contracts </b></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Contracts for performances specify the terms and conditions for live events, including money, needed equipment, and liability issues.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h3><b>Licensing Contracts </b></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These are agreements between a licensee and the owner of the song. They specify the conditions of the licensing procedure, such as the licensee's rights, the mode of payment, and the length of the license.</span>\n<h2><b>Conclusion</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The music industry relies heavily on music contracts to safeguard the rights and interests of all involved parties. Understanding the essential terms and conditions is vital for any musician or music professional hoping to succeed in the business, even though they may initially appear intimidating and complicated.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Furthermore, it is imperative that agreements explicitly and thoroughly address matters like royalties, licensing, and distribution in light of the growing popularity of digital music and streaming services.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Music contracts can change and reflect new business models and </span><a href=\"https://royalti.io/2023/11/how-blockchain-technology-is-redefining-the-future-of-music-royalty-management/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">technological advancements in the music industry</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. In the end, a carefully thought-out and structured music contract can offer a strong starting point for a prosperous career in the music business. They also guarantee that each party gets treated fairly and equally.</span>\n\n<a href=\"https://royalti.io/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Royalti.io</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> offers a clear and easy-to-use method to record split sheet contracts and automatically figure out royalty shares for each contributor added to a musical work.

    "title": "3 Lessons Asake Taught Us In 2023",
    "slug": "3-lessons-asake-taught-us-in-2023",
    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The devil may work hard, but Asake has proven without a doubt that he works harder. A general observation that many Nigerians and people worldwide can concur with, Asake doesn't look like he's stopping anytime soon. In less than two years, this man has sold out London's O2 Arena, recorded two excellent albums, and been nominated for a Grammy Award. When you talk about a new blueprint for success in the Nigerian music industry today, Asake is certainly redefining it. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ahmed Ololade has worn the Asake name with pride. He has made a profound impression on people introduced to him for the first time, who discovered he is not a woman. It is evident from all of these things and more that he has always desired to be unique. After signing with Olamide's YBNL Records in February 2022, he shot to fame with the song Omo Ope off the album Ololade, which featured Olamide. Asake, since then, has gone all the way up, and he doesn't seem to be slowing down. </span>\n<h2>Class is in session: What have we learned.</h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Asake solidified his place in the music industry in September 2022 by releasing an album that broke all previous records and nearly overshadowed his Asake name. The Apple Music record for the largest debut day for an African album was surpassed. The album \"Mr. Money with the Vibe\"  achieved the best ranking position of any Nigerian debut album in the chart's history. Peaking at number 66 on the Billboard 200 list, He was referred to as \"Mr. Money\" right away. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In June 2023, Asake's second album, \"Work of Art,\" was released in June 2023, and it continued to rank 66th on the Billboard 200 chart. This album has also won several accolades, from Grammy Awards to MTV EMA nominations. In light of these, this piece will get into some of his feats and three valuable lessons to pick from it. Let's get into it! </span>\n<h2><b>1. Uniqueness always wins </b></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One thing Asake songs always have is a special type of force. He has perfected the call-and-response African call-and-response systems with his rich backup vocals. Some would describe it as the secret to his \"street credibility.\" Every time his songs are played, music enthusiasts join in. His music is now sampled on many other platforms. On stage, he radiates confidence and total control. He is a true gentleman. More importantly, Asake stands out for his Fuji taste and fusion, which will undoubtedly continue to be his cutting edge at the profession's highest level.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As a sound, Fuji has been woven and developed into Asake's songs. The foundation of the Fuji genre is Yoruba tribal percussion. It's not a hard task, but it may lead to something new—a distinct beat from Afrobeats—and lead to flirtations with all other African tribal rhythms. Asake's uniqueness, especially in his music, is one thing that has helped him establish a strong identity in the music industry today. </span>\n<h2><b>2. Sometimes, reinventing the wheel works.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Asake learned to run from the top instead of to crawl. He stumbled upon a formula and took to it. His unbridled skill propelled him forward, and he seized the resulting possibilities. In Asake's earlier songs, there's a similar essence that these songs had in common, so much so that it was hard to tell them apart in the first few seconds of songs. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, this pattern changed in his subsequent projects. His second album, Work Of Art, didn't feature his distinctively catchy choruses, and an emphasis is now more on storytelling and soulful vocals. The eagerly awaited project displayed his growth as a musician and his dedication to crafting profound and engaging musical experiences. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The album explores themes of self-acceptance, self-discovery, and the difficulties of handling celebrity, going further into Asake's journey.</span>\n<h3><b>3. Fashion, too, has a voice. </b></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Complementing the first lesson on uniqueness, Asake's sense of flair is another thing that makes him stand out. During an interview with BETNetworks, Asake talked about how his sense of style gives him confidence. There is no set \"Asake style,\" despite the fact that he may provide tips on how to imitate his look today because everything about him defies expectations.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Similar to his deliberate attempts to sound recognizable to audiences, Asake approaches his grasp of style with the same purposefulness, which has now come to be associated with originality. Among his many different appearances since his ascent are his footwear choices and hairstyles. From his short, thick locs in \"Remember\" to his multicolored hair in \"Peace Be Unto You.\"</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Asake chooses his appearance on stage and in music videos with great care. His aim is quite clear: to be noticed. </span>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You don't have to put yourself in extra-baggy jeans, fill your neck with many neck chains, or get those grills in your teeth. However, you can learn from Asake and put some depth into your fashion. Learn how to present yourself and most importantly, your work. If there's one thing Asake has shown us, it goes a long way. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Finding and exploring the best formula that works for you is the ultimate lesson given to us by Asake. There's a platform today that helps you attain it with ease and conviction, and that's Royati.io. </span>\n\n<a href=\"https://royalti.io/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Royalti.io</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> is an all-in-one platform for accounting and catalogue management for music businesses, whether you are a distribution firm, artist, or record label.

    "title": "The Importance Of Music Catalogues For Music Artistes",
    "slug": "the-importance-of-music-catalogues-for-music-artistes",
    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Many can testify that acquisitions of music catalogues have been the talk of the music industry in recent years. While these property exchanges have always occurred in the music industry, major capital players have recently become very interested in them. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Multi-million dollar deals have created significant momentum, and music catalogue valuations are continually increasing, largely due to the ever-expanding streaming economy. However, all these developments beg the question, “What is a music catalogue?”</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In this piece, we'll explore the concept of music catalogues, their unique applications in the music business, and their immense benefits for music artists. </span>\n<h2><b>What Are Music Catalogues?</b></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A music catalogue is an assortment of musical recordings that are under the ownership of a record label, music publishing house, or artiste. It contains every song that a performer has ever released under their name or through a label, as well as any associated intellectual property like lyrics and melodies.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Record labels and musicians can benefit greatly from access to music catalogues. They can be used as collateral for loans and other financial transactions, bringing in a sizable amount of money through royalties and licencing agreements.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Some people may be the sole owners of the rights to the music they have composed and published, although this is a rather uncommon circumstance in the current music industry. The parties collaborating to create the musical pieces typically split the song copyrights.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In addition to the performing artist or band, publishers, record labels, and other stakeholders frequently receive a split share of the rights. Which they can include in their portfolios. This implies that a single song may appear in several distinct music catalogues and, as a result, may get varying royalties.</span>\n<h2><b>Music Catalogues In The Music Business: Why Investors Are Interested </b></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In addition to the sentimental attachment that listeners may have to certain tracks, music catalogues offer other benefits to investors. </span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Recently, investors seeking to diversify their portfolios with non-traditional asset classes have begun to pay more attention to music catalogues. Specifically, those with a proven track record of delivering steady royalty income flows. </span></li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Due to the royalties it generates, music is not only an asset that is uncorrelated with financial markets. Therefore, it is unaffected by the changes that more conventional financial assets may encounter, but it also has a periodic cash flow.</span></li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Standalone songs are rarely a good investment because they are highly erratic. Usually dependent on the success of the song and the person who wrote it. On the other hand, a music catalogue distributes that risk among numerous songs, each generating its own royalty income stream. </span></li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You can diversify even more by having record catalogues featuring various artists or bands. Apart from their lack of correlation with conventional financial markets, music catalogues with a track record of success also tend to perform steadily; industry norms for valuation suggest that net yearly returns might range from 5% to 16%.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Music is always changing and expanding, as seen by the rise of social media and premium streaming services. This can only imply that, in the short and long term, music and the royalties it earns can develop into a wise and reliable financial asset class that can produce income more consistently than most traditional financial assets. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But one thing that anyone should never overlook is a music catalogue that needs proper management and has all royalty income streams well tracked, even if it contains the most well-known tunes. That's where </span><a href=\"https://royalti.io/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Royalti.io</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> comes in. You have to ensure you're earning the most out of your song in terms of royalties. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With the help of our platform for managing music royalties, you can track how much your catalogue earns over a period and accurately evaluate/project its future worth.</span>\n\n&nbsp;",

    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Be it unfettered access to the wealth of inspiration from their lives or other people's lives, catching creative drifts from conversations, situations, and beats, or navigating the sheer incidental poetry of words, the job of music songwriters sounds like it is filled with fun and ease, but it is not that simple. If you have ever wondered what the job description looks like, here is some research we have done for you.</span>\n<h2><b>Who are Music Songwriters?</b></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The most understandable way to describe music songwriters is that they are lyricists, recorders of words in lines to be sung later. Music songwriters are interpreters of thoughts that could only be (better) passed through music. These thoughts could become just one song, a small EP, or an entire album. Whatever the case, the job of songwriters is to note the genre of music an artiste wants and write lyrics that align with that genre of music. If a song primarily comes off as shallow or tacky to listeners, the music songwriter is the first person who has failed.</span>\n<h2><b>What do Music Songwriters Do?</b></h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h3><b>Identify genre</b></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Most lyrics are born from the genre of music the artiste is looking out for. For instance, if an artiste wants an R&amp;B, the lyrics must elicit a richly emotional and rhythmic response in the listeners. The responsibility of a music songwriter is to pen down words that will have that exact effect when they become a song.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h3><b>Make creative contributions</b></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The music songwriter's job is to suggest meaningful and impactful ideas to the artiste about the kind of song being written. If the artiste is looking for an Afro number and has decided to have sentences like “It's snowing here in Korea,” the music songwriter can just chip in, quite politely, that an Afro song should be about the vignettes of Black or African heritage and conditions, and so “It's snowing here in Korea” would not work at all.</span><b></b>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h3><b>Branding</b></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As a music songwriter, your tasks include ensuring that your artiste's songs stay fresh and up-to-date. Your greatest tool is creativity. You have to come up with new ideas, different ideas, to keep the brand of your artiste polished. There is a target audience for every song, so work with that. Be prolific because words that would appeal to a reggae audience might be missed by lovers of rock, no matter how similar you think both genres are. Your artiste needs to remain relevant, so keep the brand marketable with how flexible you are with your lyrics.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h3><b>Protect the Artiste's Interests</b></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Loyalty is central to a songwriter's responsibilities. The songwriter must guard the artiste's talent, nurture it, and promote it. Since the songwriter can offer suggestions, these suggestions must not overshadow the artiste's interest, which must come first. The songwriter's job is to find a middle ground that will please the artiste and, at the same time, advance the public image or reception of the artiste's works.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n<h3><b>Network</b></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The right associations are essential in music. Who you relate with and the connections you make all matter. The relevance of an artist in connection to songwriting cannot be overstated. If a songwriter does not relate with other music makers to access updated information and identify styles and strategies that will spice up their skill and output, the artiste will be stranded at mediocre levels and could be isolated in the rush of refurbished talents that goes on in the music industry.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n<h3><b>The Miscellaneous Things</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">:</span></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This rests first on the relationship between the songwriter and the artiste. Other factors are the career stage at which the artiste is and the size of the artiste's staff. A music songwriter can double as the chauffeur, manager, accountant, or even personal assistant to the artiste if necessary.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Yikes! That looks like some heavy research. Please note that an artiste can be their songwriter, too, especially if they are into certain spiritual music. Gospel singers usually write their songs.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Here is a reminder that </span><a href=\"https://royalti.io/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Royalti.io</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> is an all-in-one catalog management and accounting platform for music businesses.

    "title": "5 Ways Technology Is Revolutionizing Accounting In The Music Industry",
    "slug": "5-ways-technology-is-revolutionizing-accounting-in-the-music-industry",
    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> The music industry has changed significantly in the last several years due to the development of technology and the Internet. Several innovations in the music industry have shown numerous transformations the space has undergone and how it has evolved. This digital revolution has also altered how we buy, listen to, and make music. These days, we have global access to streaming music, can interact with musicians, and even create our songs. In this piece, we'll look at five significant ways technology is revolutionizing accounting within the music industry. How music businesses are still adopting these changes?</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Technology has been instrumental in reshaping the music industry and transforming music creation, consumption, and distribution in the last several decades. Accounting isn't also left out among the numerous parts of the music industry that have experienced changes through technology. The way music businesses handle and report on their finances has fundamentally changed due to the quick uptake of cloud-based technologies, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and machine learning.</span>\n<h2><b>Cloud-based Accounting Software </b></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Cloud-based accounting software has revolutionized how many companies, including music businesses, handle their financial data. This accounting software, formerly exclusive to big companies, is now reasonably priced enough for smaller firms and drastically decreases the time it takes to get started.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Purchasing software, working on an installation, and importing data into a database are no longer required. As an alternative, a business can start up in a matter of minutes. Financial reports are sent instantly with cloud-based accounting software, and authorized users can access data from anywhere.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Companies have been able to change their business model by utilizing the flexibility of cloud-based accounting software and embracing it fast.</span>\n<h2><b>Artificial Intelligence And Machine Learning </b></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The past few years have undoubtedly witnessed a rise in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) use. Besides cloud-based accounting software, artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities have been leveraged by cloud-based CRM systems, email marketing automation tools, and other developing applications.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There's now the use of algorithms by artificial intelligence to analyze vast volumes of data instantly. Many also employ machine learning to do this study more individually or as a \"big data\" investigation. Data points are linked together using machine learning capabilities to search for trends and forecast future opportunities based on historical performance.</span>\n<h2><b>Blockchain technology </b></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Blockchain technology is one of the most fascinating financial developments to enter the market. This decentralized network guards against fraud and tampering while storing data.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This makes it </span><a href=\"https://royalti.io/2023/11/how-blockchain-technology-is-redefining-the-future-of-music-royalty-management/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">particularly helpful for music businesses</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> like record labels that handle substantial volumes of sensitive data. Record labels, publishers, and streaming services could track all royalties paid to songwriters, producers, and performers through a public ledger maintained on the blockchain. As a result, there would be less room for corruption and a more readily available system.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Before people can use blockchain for everything, a few difficulties related to scaling and latency reduction need to be worked out, but as knowledge increases, its use will likely increase.</span>\n<h2><b>Robotic Process Automation (RPA)</b></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Another of the most intriguing innovations in the accounting sector is robotic process automation or RPA. With the help of this application, businesses can automate repetitive operations, giving their staff more time to concentrate on higher-value work. Among the most often used applications of RPA are:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Administrative Tasks: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Companies can use RPA to automate repetitive operations that don't call for a lot of thought or originality, like data entry</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Human Intelligence Jobs:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> RPA also comes in handy to automate more sophisticated jobs requiring human intelligence, such as data analysis and decision-making.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Fraud Detection:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Artificial intelligence algorithms have come a long way. However, fraud can be automatically detected and prevented with RPA.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Tasks related to Compliance:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> RPA can assist companies in adhering to rules by keeping track of employee work hours. For small organizations that find it challenging to comply with numerous requirements, RPA can be a good lifesaver. </span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Reporting Tasks:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> RPA can assist companies in producing reports. RPA can be especially beneficial for companies, such as music businesses, that generate many customized reports.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b>Mobile Applications</b></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While this innovation may have risen mainly because of mobile banking, other businesses also adopt this model and operate differently. These days, mobile applications are more than just a practical financial tool. Many companies, including the music business, now require them. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, this means that businesses that use this technology must develop fresh strategies for updating and enhancing the functioning of their apps. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Due to elevated mobility, businesses will also have more opportunities to gather data. This will help them develop new products and services and reach more informed choices. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With all these technologies rising in accounting, the music business is included in the significant changes currently happening there. A new wave of technology, such as blockchain technology and Cloud-based software, is leading the way for rapid change. That's why it's essential to have a system that precisely tracks and controls royalties as more and more musicians switch to independent labels and distribution methods.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Look no further because </span><a href=\"https://royalti.io/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Royalti.io</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> is here for you. We are a state-of-the-art platform for managing music royalties from all around the world.

    "title": "The Business of Music: Understanding Distribution and Publishing",
    "slug": "the-business-of-music-understanding-distribution-and-publishing",
    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Kahlil Gibran said, “Music is the language of the spirit…,” a saying that has reverberated timelessly. Some people are privileged to speak that language eloquently, and it does not hurt that they can and should get paid for their talent, especially if that talent is a money maker. The most important aspect of the music business post-release is royalty tracking. It is not enough for an artist to focus solely on honing their craft. They must understand the business side of music; music distribution, music publishing, how to not leave potential revenue on the table by tracking their royalties, and so on.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Although some might think that royalty tracking and collection entails music distribution alone, that is not entirely true. While music distribution ensures revenue collection from streaming/download platforms, another aspect of protecting contributors' copyrights in music (especially songwriters and composers) is ensuring they are also paid their due royalties. This process is called music publishing. But before we continue, let's quickly recap what music distribution is.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 24px;color: #008080\"><b>Music Distribution</b></span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When you think about music distribution, you think about getting the music to the broadest audience. It is the process of delivering music from the artist to the market, making it available to consumers. This can be achieved through streaming and digital download platforms, CDs, and vinyl. A distributor’s priority is working with record labels or independent artists to get the music into as many Digital Service Providers (DSPs) as possible.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Although vinyl is making a recent comeback, digital platforms have revolutionized the way we consume music. Music distribution has slowly shifted from the traditional sale of CDs and cassettes to what we now term digital music distribution. To learn more, check out this post on </span><span style=\"color: #000000\"><strong><a style=\"color: #000000\" href=\"https://royalti.io/2022/08/digital-distribution-in-nigeria/\">digital music distribution</a>.</strong></span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 24px;color: #008080\"><b>Music Publishing</b></span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Music publishing focuses on music composition, songwriting, and lyrics royalties. It involves the management and monetization of a song's composition and lyrics. The publisher ensures that you collect your owed royalties for the exploitation of the music. Whenever the compositions are reproduced (mechanical royalties), used or synchronized against content or visuals (sync licensing), or performed publicly (performance royalties), the publisher ensures payment. These are just a few examples. Perhaps we will talk about what to look out for when choosing a publisher and the highlights of a music publishing agreement in a later post. For now, it is good to note that there are many instances where music publishing is essential in royalty distribution.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 24px;color: #008080\"><b>Difference</b></span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Royalty tracking and royalty distribution are the basic similarities between music distribution and music publishing, so let’s look at their differences.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 18px;color: #008080\"><b>Scope:</b></span></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Music Distribution focuses on the distribution and availability of sound recordings.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Music Publishing focuses on the exploitation of the underlying composition and lyrics.</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 18px;color: #008080\"><b>Roles:</b></span></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Music Distribution prioritizes the distribution of the song, ensuring it reaches as many hands as possible.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Music Publishing prioritizes songwriters and composers, managing the copyrights and royalties associated with the composition.</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 18px;color: #008080\"><b>Revenue Streams:</b></span></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Music Distribution manages revenue from sales, streams, and physical distribution.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Music Publishing manages revenue from performance royalties, mechanical royalties, sync licenses, and other licensing agreements.</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 18px;color: #008080\"><b>Key Players:</b></span></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Music Distribution involves distributors, record labels, independent artists, and digital platforms.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Music Publishing involves music publishers, performance rights organizations or collecting societies, songwriters, and composers.</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 24px;color: #008080\"><b>Conclusion</b></span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are two different copyrights derived from music: the rights in the “sound recording” and the “composition/lyrics,” and for each of these, the owner is entitled to revenue collection. Yes, the artist and the songwriter can be the same person, but that is not always the case. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How can a Nigerian artist, especially an independent artist, take advantage of music publishing? Get representation, preferably an entertainment lawyer, explore the various options available to you, and get attuned to the business side of music. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are quite a few Nigerian music publishing companies, and some of them have publishing agreements with international publishing companies. This is important information because the nature of music publishing is territorial. While music distribution focuses on collecting royalties from the master recording, some companies may also offer publishing services. However, you should find out what specific royalty types will be collected on your behalf. It is necessary to do your research and identify what works best for you.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You can always use </span><span style=\"color: #000000\"><a style=\"color: #000000\" href=\"http://royalti.io\"><b>Royalti.io</b></a></span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">to analyze and make sense of all this revenue metadata pulled from different sources in a simple, decompressed dashboard. Not only does it sort your earnings, but it also reads splits contracts, and displays royalty shares accordingly.</span>",

    "title": "Unlocking the Power of White Label Music Distribution for Record Labels and Distribution Companies",
    "slug": "unlocking-the-power-of-white-label-music-distribution-for-record-labels-and-distribution-companies",
    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The term “white labeling” is not exclusive to the entertainment industry. White labeling is a concept that has gained significant traction across various industries, including e-commerce and music distribution. The digitalization of marketplaces on a global scale has provided a thriving ecosystem for white labeling. This article will focus on how record labels, distribution companies, and independent artists utilize white-label solutions in music distribution. For a fraction of the cost of building a custom solution from scratch, they can use white-label distribution software and services, gaining access to a robust distribution platform.</span>\n<h3><b>What Is White Label Distribution?</b></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Imagine a company, A, that has developed a music distribution platform. This company can sell or lease its platform to another entity, B, which could be a record label, distribution company, or independent artist. Under their agreement, B can rebrand the platform, put its logo on it, and market its product offerings to third parties without mentioning A’s involvement. To any third party interacting with the distribution platform, it appears as if B is the sole provider of the service.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The same concept applies to distribution software or services. B can present these as custom solutions bearing its brand while utilizing A’s infrastructure to distribute music.</span>\n<h3><b>Key Features Of White Label Music Distribution</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n<h5><b>Source from Service Provider</b></h5>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The distribution platform or service is obtained from a service provider. This could be through a purchase or a lease arrangement.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n<h5><b>Rebranding and Customization</b></h5>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The platform or service is distributed, managed, and tracked under the name, style, and branding of the paying client (B).</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n<h5><b>Fee Structure</b></h5>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A fee is paid to the original service provider (A) for the services and the continued use of the platform.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n<h5><b>End-User Interaction</b></h5>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The end users only interact with the name and brand of the paying client (B), never knowing about the original provider (A).</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><b>Revenue Generation for White Label Service Providers.</b></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How do white-label service providers make money? Like other Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) providers, white-label service providers generate revenue through subscription fees. Which are paid to grant access to their services, subscriptions can be renewed periodically, either monthly or annually.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Also, some service providers have additional customized services as add-ons. These are tailored to the needs of the paying clients and can attract extra fees. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These services may include:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li><b>Royalty tracking and management.</b></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li><b>Brand optimization.</b></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li><b>Strategized marketing campaigns.</b></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Access to Specific Digital Service Providers (DSPs)</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> through existing partnership contracts.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Revenue sharing is another method for service providers to generate income.

    "title": "How Spotify's 2024 Royalty Model Will Reshape Music Distribution",
    "slug": "spotify-new-royalty-model-streaming-fraud",
    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">After what seemed like an eternity, Spotify has finally unveiled its new royalty model. With so many industry partners to collaborate with and come to an agreement with, it is no surprise the process took so long.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What Are We Talking About? </span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Spotify made major changes to its policies, primarily focusing on cracking down on streaming fraud. The DSP giant has always been vocal about stream manipulation and content misrepresentation being the bane of Digital Streaming Platforms. Streaming fraud is a challenge not just to Spotify, but also to other platforms. With the rise of digital streaming services, some unscrupulous actors continue to find new ways to secure undeserved payouts from the system and deprive genuine content creators of well-earned profits. Let's break down the Spotify business model to understand what streaming fraud is and why it is such a problem.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Spotify Business Model</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It is no secret that Spotify has two basic subscription plans: premium and free. The premium option has a subscription fee attached for whichever category is chosen (individual, duo, family, and so on). For the free plan, Spotify runs an advertisement network. Free users have to listen to ads to use the platform. This also pulls in revenue for the platform as well. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That advertisement and subscription revenue are shared between the platform and the artists and creators whose songs and content are being used. In 2024, Spotify pays an average of $0.003 per stream. While this might seem small, it accumulates significantly with more streams. This simple math underpins the problem of streaming fraud.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Streaming Fraud</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In 2017, a Bulgarian playlist-maker allegedly exploited the Spotify payout system for months. The platform uncovered two playlists: “Soulful Music” and “Music from the Heart” which were used for this undertaking. These playlists seemingly racked up top spots on the “Spotify Global 100 Charts” and generated substantial revenue. It was not the first time streaming fraud had been uncovered by the platform. However, the sheer size of this operation highlighted the vulnerabilities in the system.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Over time, Spotify has continued to evolve its policies in an attempt to limit the economic impact of these activities. However, from the use of “AI-generated bogus tracks” to the abuse of Spotify’s “track-linking” feature, it appears that the scammers are working harder, and Spotify is being kept on its toes. In February of 2024, a Danish man was set to go on trial for allegedly profiting over £500,000, by fraudulently generating playbacks across multiple streaming platforms including Spotify. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">At the center of streaming fraud is the manipulation of the \"functional\" genre. This includes sounds like white noise, whale calls, nature sounds, and even silent recordings. These are typically played in the background by users. Before Spotify's new policies, there was a play-time threshold of just 30 seconds for the functional genre. This made it an attractive option for those looking to exploit the system.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Spotify’s Response</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So Spotify rolled up its sleeves and tightened its belt. It worked for almost a whole year to update its policies, and in the Nigerian pidgin English parlance, ‘now everywhere don tight’. </span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Charges For Artificial Streaming:</span></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">First, Record labels and distributors will be charged per track whenever artificial streaming is detected on their content. This charge shall be imposed only when a high rate of artificial streaming has been detected on a particular track. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The platform insists that it has invested in improved technology for detecting artificial streaming, this new policy is an attempt to discourage record labels and distributors from participating in or turning a blind eye to artificial activity.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Track Monetization Eligibility: </span></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The demonetization of tracks that previously received 0.5% of Spotify’s royalty pool. These tacks must now have a minimum of 1,000 streams within the preceding 12 months to be eligible for recorded royalties. Otherwise, that money is redistributed on the platform to songs that meet the criteria through Spotify’s streamshare royalty pot. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">According to the platform, the aim is to distribute better small payments that are not reaching the artists, as they may not surpass the minimum withdrawal threshold set by some distributors.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">New Policy For Noise Recordings</span></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And finally, the crackdown on noise track royalties. Now the functional genre must have a 2-minute minimum track length to be eligible to generate royalties. This is opposed to the 30-second minimum that was permitted last year. Therefore, 2 minutes of listening to white noise content will only amount to one royalty-bearing stream instead of four. Additionally, there are still talks to have noise streams valued at a fraction of the value of music streams.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This removes the incentive to cut tracks to ridiculous 30-second lengths (just enough to meet the play-time threshold) at the expense of the listener’s experience. You can check out these new </span><a href=\"https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/modernizing-our-royalty-system\"><b>policies</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> in detail.</span>\n\n<a href=\"https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/article/third-party-services-that-guarantee-streams/\"><b>Spotify</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> also included that third-party promotional services, specifically those advertising streams in return for payment violate its terms and conditions. And using these services could have significant consequences, such as the track being removed from the platform.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Future Trends</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With the new policy, we expect major changes and policy implementations in how music distribution as a business is run. Seeing as record labels and distributors are to be held monetarily culpable when artificial streaming is detected.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Rise of In-House Monitoring Systems</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: There could be a rise in in-house monitoring systems to detect unusual streaming patterns early and address potential fraud before it triggers penalties from Spotify.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Revised Distribution Contracts</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: Contracts could change, including more stringent clauses with artists and management teams, that ensure all parties understand the consequences of engaging in artificial streaming practices. </span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Change in Promotional Strategies</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: There is also anticipated to be a shift in promotional strategies and a focus on more organic growth methods. this will allow prioritization of genuine audience engagement and boosting legitimate streams. </span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Quality Over Quantity in Track Releases</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: Artists and record labels may focus less on the number of tracks released and channel more resources on promoting fewer but higher-quality tracks. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How Royalti.io Can Help</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With Spotify’s new royalty model and streaming policies, one thing remains unchanged: the need for trust and transparency in the music business. Record labels and distribution companies, still need systems in place to help Implement internal audit and royalty reporting, as well as a system to regularly review streaming data and ensure compliance with Spotify’s policies. </span><a href=\"http://royalti.io\"><b>Royalti.io</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> is a platform that offers transparency and strengthens trust and partnership among rights holders. Royalty data is simplified and viewed at a glance, and rights holders have real-time access to these data.</span>",

    "title": "Essential Tips for Independent Artists: Mastering Music Distribution",
    "slug": "independent-artists-music-distribution-tips",
    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Some artists choose to handle every aspect of their music career, from creation to distribution, without relying on big industry players. The purpose of this post is not to weigh in on whether this is a good or bad idea; it is only to provide resources for consideration for any artist who wishes to distribute their music independently. What basic points should an independent artist consider when distributing music directly for efficient royalty tracking?</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Pros Of Direct Distribution</span></h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n<h4><b>Maintaining Control:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Independent artists control all creative, administrative, and promotional decisions. Artists can ensure their vision is fully realized without external influence.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n<h4><b>Monopoly on Royalty Shares:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Retaining nearly 100% of the proceeds from the music allows independent artists to maximize their earnings from royalties. This financial autonomy is a significant benefit of direct distribution.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n<h4><b>Complete Ownership of Copyrights:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The copyrights in the master recordings or compositions belong solely to the independent artist, who has autonomy over their music license. This ownership ensures long-term control and the ability to exploit their music rights fully.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n<h4><b>Leveraging Social Media:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Instead of waiting for record deals that might never come, independent artists leverage the power of the internet, particularly social media, to get their music to their audience and grow a fanbase—something almost impossible two and a half decades ago. However, building a fanbase is not the only effort required. An independent artist must understand how to leverage this fan growth and harness that potential into actual revenue.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Understanding Music Distribution</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are a lot of digital distribution platforms whose service offerings are targeted at independent artists. These platforms often promise support and guidance to alleviate administrative hurdles and ensure effective royalty tracking. Some provide white-label services, offering a hassle-free opportunity for independent artists to upload their music to their digital streaming platform (DSP) partners. Pricing models for these platforms vary, including subscription fees, annual payments, and royalty share arrangements.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Physical Distribution: </span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Although CD and vinyl sales are not what they used to be, it is still an option to explore. Vinyl, in particular, has seen a resurgence in popularity and can be a valuable revenue stream for independent artists.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Copyrights and Royalties</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Every artist must understand copyrights, not just as rights bestowed on the tangible form of their music but also as intellectual property capable of being sold or licensed. There is so much revenue made from music: performance bookings, merchandising for artists and albums, licensing, and sponsorship opportunities. Music is truly the gift that keeps on giving. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, all that potential income remains just that—potential—unless you have the knowledge and resources to exploit the endless possibilities of music royalties.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Understanding Royalties:</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Royalties are income generated from creative work and must be distributed to all who contributed to the work, also known as rights holders. Royalties are usually shared based on pre-agreed terms contained in a document known as a split sheet. Check out these articles on </span><a href=\"https://royalti.io/2023/11/what-are-music-royalties/\"><b>royalties</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and </span><a href=\"https://royalti.io/2022/04/explaining-split-sheets/\"><b>split sheets</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to learn more.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the world of digital streaming, royalties have been distilled into a game of numbers, with the size of the fanbase and social media popularity translating to the number of streams and, ultimately, the amount of royalties received. For the most part, independent artists enjoy sole ownership of accruing royalties. Although royalty tracking and analyzing metadata pulled from different sources could pose a challenge, tools like </span><a href=\"http://royalti.io\"><b>Royalti.io</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> offer a way to simplify this process.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Marketing Promotions</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To promote is to increase visibility, it is taking the music to the audience. A successful marketing strategy translates to high streams and royalties. Therefore, it is the essence of music distribution. Music promotion takes skill, effort, time and most importantly, it takes money. </span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Social Media Strategies and Digital Marketing Tools:</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The internet has made music promotion slightly more accessible especially for independent artists. Social media provides a means to get in the faces of the target audience and an opportunity to connect with fans on a personal level. However, even that requires effort, strategy, and intentionality to yield long-term benefits. Some artists use digital marketing tools like; SEO, email marketing, and content creation to enhance their online presence.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Financial Management</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">“Making music ain’t cheap”. There is a reason why signing to record labels is considered a win and the obvious choice for some. However, it is not as if record deals are just handed out. Those opportunities are rare and far between. Some artists start small and scale their efforts with time and success. The priority is usually getting the music out into the world, to as many ears, while spending as little as possible. There are a lot of free resources focused on increasing content visibility and promoting engagement that an independent artist could use to introduce their music to the world. Budgeting and planning effectively can help in sustaining an independent music career</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Legal Consideration</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The music industry is largely directed by understandings and partnerships reduced to physical form as a contract. Whether you are recording, collaborating, or distributing, the importance of understanding terms and clauses in the contract cannot be over-emphasized. The best approach is to get legal representation; navigating the industry as an independent artist is no joke, so stay smart and keep learning.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The list of considerations is not exhaustive, but this is our top 5, guaranteed to cover the basics. Whether this is your first rodeo in independent music distribution or you are just looking for ways to improve, it won’t hurt to keep these in mind.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Check out our previous </span><a href=\"https://royalti.io/blog/\"><b>posts</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, for more tips and resources on navigating the music industry as a record label, distribution company, or independent artist. They’re packed with valuable insights to help you succeed in your music career. </span>",

    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">On July 30, 2024, Nigeria mourned the loss of one of its most cherished entertainers, Onyeka Onwenu. Onyeka’s passing marks a national loss. This post will celebrate the iconic and phenomenal Onyeka Onwenu, Known for her powerful voice, activism, and contributions to social change. </span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Early Life </span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Madam Onyeka Onwenu was born on January 31, 1952, an indigene of Arondizuogu, Imo state, Nigeria. A graduate of international relations and communications from Wellesley College in Massachusetts, she also earned an MA in media studies from the New School for Social Research, New York, USA.  She has been </span><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130416011905/http://www.nigerianbestforum.com/generaltopics/i-went-on-hunger-strike-when-ben-bruce-barred-me-from-being-shown-on-nta-%E2%80%93onyeka-onwenu/\"><b>quoted</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> as saying that she returned to Nigeria because she was tired of waiting for the change she wanted to see in her country. Indeed, living true to the Igbo adage says “It is where one lives that they improve”. Madam Onwenu not only talked the talk but also embodied her advocacy through her art and intellectual contributions.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Career Beginnings</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Upon her return to Nigeria, Onyeka Onwenu's first job was with the Nigerian Television Authority. She lent her voice and pen to social causes and made a documentary film titled </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nigeria: A Squandering of Riches</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, a documentary that remains relevant today.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Music Career</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Her music career began in the early 1980s with her album ‘</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For the Love of You’</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. She went on to release numerous albums, and multiple collaborations and became an award-winning actress. Onyeka Onwenu has released songs across various genres including pop, blues, highlife, and gospel. The success of her song \"One Love\", which was widely received across the country made her a household name.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Influence on the Music Industry</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In 2000, she advocated for her rights to royalties from the broadcast of her music by the Nigerian Television Authority. She did this by staging a hunger protest at the gates of the broadcasting corporation in Lagos. Her actions did not go unnoticed but drew significant public attention and the support of her fellow artists. In her </span><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130416011905/http://www.nigerianbestforum.com/generaltopics/i-went-on-hunger-strike-when-ben-bruce-barred-me-from-being-shown-on-nta-%E2%80%93onyeka-onwenu/\"><b>words</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> “I couldn’t rationalize investing and having a recording and not making any money out of it”. She staged her hunger strike for six days and only called it off when she reached an agreement with the corporation. </span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Top 5 songs</span></h3>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ekwe </span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The first time I heard \"Ekwe\" was in a Nigerian home movie, where the actress used it to express an exaggerated show of jest and pettiness. Intrigued, I went looking for the song. It turns out it was one of those scenarios where the lyrics were taken out of context for light humor. \"Ekwe\" is a story of love and rejection, with a lively beat and infectious rhythm incorporating traditional and contemporary instruments. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The 1984 song, draws from a sense of joy and fun, so much so that we lose sight of the fact that \"Ekwe\" is about a man whose love advances are being vehemently rejected. Onyeka Onwenu was a profound storyteller, using music as her medium of choice. She gave us songs that encapsulated the spirit of celebration. \"Ekwe\" is a fusion of cultural elements into modern music, making it relatable to a wide audience.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One Love</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Released in 1986, \"One Love\" is a popular favorite. Its socially conscious lyrics advocate peace, unity, and tolerance, and it was widely received by many. In a country that is a melting pot of ethnically and religiously diverse people, \"One Love\" is timeless in its message of unity and togetherness—a truly enduring piece of art. The song is a call to action, asking that people come together despite their differences. Onyeka's performance imbues the song with a sense of hope and inspiration.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You and I</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Originally released in 1986 and re-recorded in 2001, \"You and I\" is arguably the most popular love song oldies in Nigeria. The song enjoyed frequent play at weddings and events for a significant period after its release. It speaks of an enduring love, conveyed through Onyeka Onwenu’s soulful voice. Her emotive delivery and the song's timeless melody make it a cherished piece in her discography.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Iyogogo</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This song was also released in 1984, as part of the album ‘</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the Morning Light’</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Like most of Onyeka Onwenu’s work, the song is a fusion of traditional Nigerian music with contemporary sounds, embellished with a catchy chorus that stays on your lips long after the music ends. It is a testament to Onyeka Onwenu’s versatility and commitment to promoting Nigerian traditional sounds through her music. \"Iyogogo\" draws in its listeners with its rhythmic beat calling them to a joyous celebration across generations.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Wait for me</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This song became popular for its unique sound and meaningful lyrics. The legendary King Sunny Ade and Onyeka Onwenu collaborated on this song. The song was one half of a pair advocating for planned parenting and was released in 1989. It speaks of love, patience, and commitment, delivered through a harmonious blend of voices and melodic instrumentation. The collaboration between these music legends brought widespread acclaim. Their message appealed to a broad audience, and together they made a timeless classic. </span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Conclusion</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The legacy of Onyeka Onwenu is one of profound impact, leaving an indelible footprint on the Nigerian entertainment industry and embodying her enduring advocacy for social change. Our top picks illustrate the versatility of her talents, with each song delivering unique messages and melodies that will continue to resonate with audiences for years to come.</span>",

    "title": "Collaboration or Feature? Decoding Music Industry Terms for Success",
    "slug": "music-collaboration-vs-feature",
    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Though distinct, music collaborations and features are often confused terms. That’s why you read our blog: to gain clear insights on industry terms and avoid making blunders. If you haven’t guessed by now, features are not collaborations, in this post, we will break down the distinction between a feature and a collaboration.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">COLLABORATIONS</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To collaborate is to work together; in a music collaboration, two or more artists come together to create a piece of music. Collaborations are level-based contributions, each party pulls in their unique talent, style, or technique to the project. Whether through songwriting, performing, producing, or arranging, each collaborator plays equal or assigned parts in creating the music project. The result of a collaboration is a co-created work where all parties have significant input, and it can involve artists in similar or different genres.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Key Aspects of Music Collaboration</span></h3>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">1. Creative Input</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Every collaborator has a say in the creative direction of the project. This could involve co-writing lyrics, composing melodies, or producing the beats.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2. Shared Credit</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The music is a co-created work, therefore all contributing artists share credit for the final product. The project could either be as released under a joint project name, or the collaborators’ names may appear as the primary artists on the track or album.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">3. Equal Partnership</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Collaborations are equal by nature and often denote a partnership of equal efforts. If successful, collaborations can lead to long-term professional relationships, with artists continuing to work together on multiple projects over time.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">4. Genre Fusion</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It is a fusion of genres, styles, or influences, creating something unique that might not have been if the artists worked independently.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Examples of Music Collaboration</span></h3>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">1. Wizkid &amp; Tems – \"Essence\" (2020)</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Widely credited with helping to bring Afrobeat to a broader international audience, “Essence” became a global hit that topped charts worldwide, earning multiple award nominations. It was the first Nigerian song to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, to boost its popularity, it was remixed with Justin Bieber.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2. Lady Gaga &amp; Bradley Cooper – \"Shallow\" (2018)</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A duet from the soundtrack of the film “A Star is Born”, the song won the Academy Awards for Best Original Song, a Golden Globe, and several Grammy Awards. Becoming arguably more popular than the movie, the song was one of the best-selling digital singles of 2018. Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper contributed vocals and creative input, creating a song that captured the emotional intensity of the film’s storyline.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">3. Kanye West &amp; Jay-Z – </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Watch the Throne</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> (Album) (2011)</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">“</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Watch the Throne”</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> is a collaborative studio album by Kanye West and Jay-Z. The album blended both artists' styles and included contributions from a few producers and guest artists. The album spawned several hit singles and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. A landmark album in hip-hop that showcased the synergy between two of the genre's biggest names.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Collaborations are more popular than people realize. There is no doubt that the right collaborations can change the trajectory of an artist’s career. Working with other artists can inspire new ideas, and help one push creative boundaries. Even well-known artists collaborate from time to time with other artists. Beyond creating innovative music, collaborators can pool their resources to create a stronger product. Whether from past projects or potential partners for future projects, collaborations provide the right opportunity to build and expand professional networks. It promotes the exchange of ideas and the appreciation of others' techniques and allows artists to improve their skill sets. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Collaborations birth ingenuity; the song is created by combining two or more ideas, styles, and influences. It is lucrative as it allows an artist to reach a wider audience, by tapping into each other’s fanbases and potentially gaining new listeners.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">MUSIC FEATURE</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A music feature is an invitation by one artist to another artist to contribute to their song. It is the inclusion of a guest artist on a track, and the contribution could be a verse, chorus, or bridge. Compared to a full collaboration, the featured artist's role is usually more limited,  providing a complementary element to the main artist's work.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Key Aspects of a Music Feature</span></h3>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">1. Limited Contribution: </span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Contributions are limited to specific sections of the song. The featured artist typically contributes a verse or hook, rather than being involved in the entire creative process. The song is usually credited to the main artist, with the featured artist's name listed as \"feat.\" or \"featuring.\"</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2. Strategic Marketing Tool: </span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Features are used strategically to tap into the guest artist's fanbase. With the featured artist adding an extra layer of appeal, the song could have a wider reach and an enhanced commercial appeal. Features are used across genres and often as a strategic marketing tool.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">3. Creative Flexibility: </span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The focus is 100% on the primary artist, so they retain creative control over the song, with the featured artist following the lead or fitting into the existing framework.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Examples of Music Features</span></h3>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">1. Fireboy DML Feat. Ed Sheeran — “Peru” (2021)</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"Peru\" was initially released by Nigerian artist Fireboy DML in July 2021. The track quickly gained popularity across Nigeria and other parts of Africa.  In December 2021, a remix featuring Ed Sheeran was released. He added his own verse and vocal style to the track, creating a blend of Afropop that the global audience could not get enough of. It peaked at number 2 on the UK Singles Chart and entered the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. The remix garnered millions of streams on platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube. </span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2. Mark Ronson feat. Bruno Mars – \"Uptown Funk\" (2014)</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The track was a standout pop anthem that featured Bruno Mars’ energetic vocals over a retro-inspired beat. The song topped the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and held the number-one spot for 14 consecutive weeks. It also topped charts in multiple countries, won a Grammy for Record of the Year, and became one of the best-selling singles of all time.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">3. Travis Scott feat. Drake - “Sicko Mode” (2018)</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As part of the Astroworld album, the track features Drake, with a verse at the beginning of the song before Travis Scott takes over with his verses. Reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100, the track witnessed massive commercial success. It stayed on the chart for a significant amount of time becoming one of the most popular tracks of 2018. It was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Music features allow artists to blend their styles and reach new audiences without the full commitment of a ‘collaboration’. A collaboration sees ownership of the project split based on individual contributions, while in a feature,  ownership is not split but credit is accorded for the contribution. The featured artist gets paid a fee and has limited influence over the overall direction of the song. Some songs are like gold, refined through the course of multiple remixes. Artists have constantly used features to experiment with how best to complement their already-released songs. </span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Conclusion </span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Collaborations and features allow artists to blend their talents and reach new audiences. Both are deployed as tactics to promote an artist’s influence beyond their fanbase. This is important in an industry where streaming numbers are a measure of success. Music producers collaborate with artists to provide vocals; rappers feature vocalists for their songs, and vice versa.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Beyond the craft, music is a business, surrounding it with the right buzz and exposure is vital to gaining the attention that translates to album sales and sold-out concerts.</span>",

    "title": "Copyright Battles in Music: Insights from Mike Ejeagha’s Journey",
    "slug": "copyright-battles-in-music-insights-from-mike-ejeaghas-journey",
    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As a pioneer of storytelling through music in the Highlife genre, his melodies are more than just songs; they are a living archive of Igbo culture and tradition. Sir Micheal Nwachukwu Ejeagharibe (Mike Ejeagha), is a Nigerian musician, songwriter, and folklorist. With a voice so calm and clear, his name is synonymous with storytelling. He effortlessly weaves Igbo folktales into his music. His entire career is a love song to the Igbo culture, preserving oral tradition through music. He was born in Enugu State, Nigeria on April 4, 1930.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Early Life and Career</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mike Ejeagha’s music career began in the early 1960s. Inarguably, his music style is a harmonious blend of traditional folklore and highlife music—a brew that his audience found palatable and paved the way to considerable success in his career. Mike Ejeagha, also fondly known as “Gentleman,” was a household name in southeastern Nigeria. And was popular for his storytelling style, incorporating moral lessons and reflections on everyday life.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Copyrights Battle</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the early stages of his career, Sir Ejeagha entered into a perpetuity contract with Polygram Records. That contract is the basis of the ownership of the catalogs and the royalty-sharing arrangement between them. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In 2009, he was sued by the </span><a href=\"https://www.premiumtimesng.com/entertainment/music/717746-royalties-premier-records-denies-ripping-off-veteran-singer-mike-ejeagha.html\"><b>record label</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, now Premier Records, for producing a music video for one of his songs. For the next 13 years, he would be involved in legal disputes over the ownership and use of his music, with the label claiming the rights to his masters and compositions. However, this ordeal was resolved in 2019 with a consent judgment.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Career impact</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Even as Sir Ejeagha's legal battle eventually gained public attention, it was long and grueling. He has openly </span><a href=\"https://thecitizenng.com/my-two-year-legal-tussle-over-copyright-rendered-me-penniless-sick-mike-ejeagha/\"><b>expressed</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> the significant financial toll it took on him, which directly affected his livelihood and hindered his ability to continue making music. Without the rights to their work, an artist loses significant control over crucial decisions related to its use, distribution, and commercialization.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lessons Learned</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mike Ejeagha's decades-long copyright battle with his record label highlights critical lessons for artists, especially in navigating the complexities of intellectual property rights and music business dealings. His story serves as a source of insight for today's music professionals.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">1. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Understand Contracts</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One of the biggest takeaways from Sir Ejeagha’s story is the importance of fully understanding the terms of any contract before signing. In his case, a perpetuity contract with the Label severely limited his control over his music. Contracts in the music industry can be complicated. Artists must work with legal professionals to avoid unfavorable terms in these legal documents.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2. The Importance of Proper Documentation</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There is a need for artists to be better educated about their rights. Proper legal documentation and the availability of legal support for artists must be prioritized. All agreements, regarding royalties, rights, or usage, must be properly documented and legally enforceable. This will help prevent disputes down the road and provide a clear legal framework for resolving conflicts.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">3. Royalty Management and Transparency Are Crucial</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Music professionals need to prioritize transparency in royalty management. Platforms like </span><a href=\"http://royalti.io\"><b>Royalti.io</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> can provide automated solutions to ensure artists receive their fair share of earnings from music sales, streaming, and sync deals. Regular auditing of royalty reports is essential for avoiding discrepancies.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Conclusion</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mike Ejeagha’s copyright battle puts a spotlight on the broader issue of intellectual property rights in the Nigerian music industry. Today, his story serves as both a cautionary tale and an inspiration. Reminding us that many artists have faced heartbreaking struggles in a bid to own the rights to their works. Although the industry has come a long way since then, it is far from perfect. However, with advocates championing legal awareness and representation for artists, and platforms like </span><a href=\"http://royalti.io\"><b>Royalti.io</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> providing tools that prioritize accountability and transparency in royalty tracking, there is some hope.</span>",

    "slug": "immersive-tech-and-music-unlocking-new-revenue-streams-in-virtual-concerts",
    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lately, immersive technology like virtual reality (VR) has been on a steady rise in various aspects of life. In music, artists find ingenious ways to incorporate VR and even augmented reality (AR) elements in live performances and music videos. We will discuss how VR concerts are fast becoming a thing, an avenue to create new revenue streams by providing immersive experiences. We will also discuss how royalty tracking systems help ensure that artists and rights holders exploring these innovations are properly compensated for their work.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What is Immersive Technology?</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Imagine attending a music concert happening anywhere in the world without ever leaving your home, that is the promise of immersive technology. While watching concerts on TV may seem similar, immersive technology provides something more than just passive viewing. Whether through VR or engaging 2D content, immersive experience allows the audience to lose themselves in a virtual environment through technology.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Using specialized equipment, like a headset, one can experience a simulated environment, a computer-generated world with a 360-degree view. This environment can simulate real-world experiences, enabling users to interact with objects, people, and surroundings in ways traditional media cannot.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Virtual Reality Concerts: A New Interactive Experience</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Virtual reality is revolutionizing the live music experience. In addition to attending physical concerts or watching live—streams, fans can now participate in VR concerts hosted on platforms like Fortnite. And they can attend these concerts from anywhere in the world using VR headsets or even standard screens. Within these virtual environments, concert-goers can explore and enjoy special visual effects that would be impossible to replicate in a physical venue. </span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Artists Who Have Experimented with Immersive Technology</span></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">BTS: </span></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In 2020, K-pop sensation BTS held a series of online concerts called </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">BANG BANG CON.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> While not fully VR, the use of augmented reality elements enhanced the experience. It was also announced that the group would host a virtual concert on Fortnite’s Party Royale main stage later that year.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Travis Scott: </span></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We are no strangers to Travis Scott's 2020 </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Astronomical</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Concert in Fortnite.  It was one of the most iconic uses of immersive technology in Hip-Hop. His performance was rendered as a giant avatar in an interactive virtual environment. </span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Burna Boy:  </span></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In 2021, Burna Boy collaborated with MelodyVR for his </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Live from London</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> concert. Fans worldwide could attend the event virtually, using smartphones and VR headsets.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">New Revenue Streams for Artists</span></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">VR Concert Ticket Sales</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">VR concerts often require tickets, just like traditional concerts,  which generate royalties for artists, songwriters, and rights holders. With virtual concerts, however, there is a wider reach as fans from around the globe can log in without geographic limitations, creating significant potential for increased ticket sales.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In-game and Virtual World Soundtracks</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Music integrated into virtual worlds and games generates royalties every time it is played. These virtual environments are a growing source of revenue for artists whose music is featured in-game.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Virtual Merchandise and NFTs </span></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Artists can sell virtual merchandise, such as concert memorabilia during their VR concerts. Restricting access to the concert or offering exclusive digital content can equally heighten the buzz surrounding an artist's performance translating to more sales. There is also the possibility of creating NFTs (non-fungible tokens) as a way for artists to sell unique digital assets tied to their music.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Challenges in Royalty Tracking and Distributing Royalties</span></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Navigating Copyright Laws:</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">VR concerts are accessible to global audiences, raising the issue of navigating international copyright laws. Laws that can be more complex than those governing traditional digital distribution.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Real-Time Data Tracking:</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In a VR environment, real-time data tracking is essential but difficult to manage. A single performance may take place across multiple virtual platforms or worlds.  And it will be challenging to collect accurate data and ensure fair royalty distribution.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Platform Transparency:</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Platforms like Fortnite and Roblox must provide transparent and accurate royalty data. It is difficult to enforce royalty payments to artists and rights holders, without proper data collection systems in place.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Conclusion</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Without a doubt, virtual reality is changing how music is experienced. And it continues to gain momentum, necessitating artists to consider leveraging its technology to optimize their earnings. Therefore, transparency in royalty tracking for global digital performances is the key to ensuring fair compensation for artists in this ever-changing digital space. Fortunately, platforms like </span><a href=\"http://royalti.io\"><b>Royalti.io</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> are already poised to address these challenges. As a tool that consolidates data from various platforms and simplifies music catalog management and royalty tracking, it offers an efficient way to track music usage across digital channels.

    "slug": "social-media-banter-the-strategic-power-of-controversy",
    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Attracting and holding the attention is the bread and butter of an artist. With the popularity of social media, artists and their teams have consistently used social media-focused marketing practices. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Artists have found creative ways to keep their audience interested, engaged, and entertained. The ethics of some of these practices is a topic for another day. At </span><a href=\"http://royalti.io\"><b>Royalti.io</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, we do not judge, we simply provide the best tool to manage music catalogs and contracts, track royalties, and analyze metadata. Social media banter can be humorous and light-hearted, but it is often the opposite. Regardless of the tone, it is carefully curated as part of a broader marketing strategy. We will explore how it is used and why. Additionally, we'll highlight successful scenarios where artists achieved commercial success amidst settled or ongoing social media banter.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Art of Banter</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Provocative interactions on social media draw attention—it's as simple as that. It's the art of stirring public interest by leveraging the public's fascination with the private lives of celebrities. Call it a distraction from reality or a brief respite from everything else they have going on, but humans have always been fascinated by others’ business. As someone wisely said, it’s about \"validating our own humanity through other people's problems,\" making us feel less alone. Whatever the reason, one thing is clear: someone realized one day that attention could translate into commercial success if properly channeled. The rest, as they say, is history.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How Does Social Media Banter Function As A Strategic Tool</span></h2>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Viral Potential:</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Banter enhances visibility and reach. A well-placed tweet or Instagram post can quickly go viral, extending its reach far beyond an artist's immediate fanbase. With each like or retweet, the artist’s potential to go viral increases. This surge in visibility often leads to more followers, greater media coverage, and higher streaming numbers. Sometimes, these activities spill over from one social media platform to another, offering cost-effective cross-platform promotion. There’s no better way to boost engagement than by sharing content so juicy that it gets reshared and commented on without solicitation.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Managing Controversy:</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Using social media, artists can effectively manage controversy and negative press by controlling their narrative. When artists respond to criticism with humor or a clever retort, they can defuse potentially damaging situations. This approach allows them to share their side of the story and turn the situation into a positive engagement opportunity. Creating and maintaining a public persona has become easier than ever. Social media banter allows artists to reinforce these personas and project the image they and their team want the world to see.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Creating Buzz:</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When banter centers around an upcoming event or tour, it creates a sense of urgency and feverish anticipation among fans. Garnering extensive media attention and amplifying the event’s reach is seemingly a worthy consolation for being ‘dragged’ across the streets of social media. The bigger the buzz, the higher the potential sales, from concert tickets to streaming numbers, all thanks to a cleverly timed tweet.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Has Banter Ever Worked </span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Naira Marley’s “Am I a Yahoo Boy”  was released amidst a social media firestorm, keeping the artist in the headlines whilst witnessing a surge in popularity. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Time and again, we have seen big names in the music scene take jabs at each other on social media, sometimes subtle, sometimes overt, each time keeping the focus on the combatants and building anticipation for their upcoming projects. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The 2015 feud between Drake Vs. Meek Mill,  the 2018 clash between Nicki Minaj and Cardi B, and the 2020 rivalry between Burna Boy and Davido are just a few that come to mind. As tensions rise and fans rally behind their favorite artists, the spotlight remains on them, providing dedicated media coverage, increased streams, album sales, and social media engagement—a perfectly executed marketing strategy.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Conclusion</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Misjudged jokes or comments, as well as playful banter, can easily be interpreted as offensive or inappropriate. These risks are important to consider when using social media banter as a marketing tactic.  Therefore, it is still a good idea for artists and their teams to consider the potential impact of their posts and interactions. In an industry where staying relevant and engaging with the audience is crucial, mastering the art of social media banter is becoming an informal skill.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Positive or negative, the impact of banter on an artist’s career can vary based on the circumstances. While we haven't seen an artist canceled specifically due to social media banter in Nigeria, over-reliance on this tactic can sometimes overshadow the artist’s music or message. It’s essential to balance it with other forms of content and engagement.</span>",

    "title": "A Decade of Rhythms: Nigerian Music In The '60s",
    "slug": "a-decade-of-rhythms-nigerian-music-in-the-60s",
    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As part of a new segment, we will be releasing a series of posts throughout the year, each tracing the evolution of Nigerian music from the 1960s to the present. Each segment will explore each decade’s lyrical compositions and experimentations, dominant genres, and celebrated artists who helped shape the sound of their time. We begin our discussion with post-colonial Nigeria, from the optimism of independence in 1960 to the post-civil war era of 1970. How did this period lay the groundwork for the Nigerian music we enjoy today? What was Nigerian music in the '60s like?</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Challenges in Researching Nigeria's Music Legacy</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Only a few collections specifically chronicle music year by year for the decade in question, so research had to be done individually on popular artists of the time. Apologies in advance if your favorite artist isn’t mentioned. That being said, one of the albums I found is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nigerian Freedom Sounds</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> by Soul Jazz Records, a collection of works from 1960 featuring a diverse range of artists, including I.K. Dairo, E.C. Arinze, and Sammy Akpabot. This helped narrow down our focus to a few artists, whom we will discuss momentarily.  </span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Sound of Independence: 1960's Airways</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Post-independence Nigerian music took on a sound that might surprise those expecting a heavy dominance of Western influences. Instead, Nigerians blended foreign elements with their rich, cultural heritage, to create a unique musical identity. Western instruments were played alongside traditional ones like the talking drums and the Udu, producing music that was distinctively Nigerian. Simple, repetitive lyrics, infectious choruses, and a fast-paced rhythm characterized songs from this era. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The golden era for bands, Nigerian music of the '60s saw every performer have their own ensemble of backup singers, instrumentalists, and sometimes dancers. The 60s truly seemed like a celebratory and vibrant time for Nigerian music.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Pioneers of the '60s: Shaping Nigeria’s Musical Identity</span></h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I.K Diaro</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Isaiah Kehinde Dairo, born in 1930 in Kwara State, Nigeria, is widely regarded as a pioneer of juju music. Though he started his career in the mid-50s,  it was in the early 1960s that his career truly flourished. With his band, The Blue Spot, Dairo earned praise for his innovative approach to juju music, blending traditional Yoruba sounds with Western instruments such as the guitar and accordion. This fusion created a rich blend of rhythm and beats that retained the originality of juju music while introducing new elements. Dairo was also celebrated for his ability to sing in multiple Nigerian languages.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">E.C Arinze</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Eleazar Chukwuemeka Arinze was a prolific trumpeter and one of the pioneers of highlife music in the mid-1960s, helping to shape the genre into the recognizable sound we know today. In the 60s, he performed at packed nightclubs, including the famous Kakadu in Lagos. However, with the outbreak of the civil war in 1967, like many Igbo Nigerians, E.C. Arinze relocated to the east. The civil war marked a pivotal moment that would be a turning point in the evolution of Nigerian music. Genres like highlife, once at the height of national recognition, experienced a setback in mainstream popularity and instead, flourished in eastern Nigeria.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Victor Uwaifo</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fondly known as Guitar Boy, Victor Uwaifo consistently pushed the boundaries of traditional music throughout his career, experimenting with sounds to create entirely new genres. This is evident in his </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Akwete</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> music,  which brought him widespread recognition, as well as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Shadow</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, which he described as a blend of Akwete and twist, and </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ekkassa</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, a traditional Benin sound, that he elevated by fusing it with highlife, rock, and soul music. His life and career are marked by numerous accolades, including the Member Order of the Niger in 1983, along with a host of other awards and honors.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Osita Osadebe</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Stephen Osita Osadebe, famously known as \"The Doctor of Hypertension,\" began his musical journey in the mid-1950s. Although he was already renowned in the early stages of his career, the world would still bear witness to his amazing talent in the 80s. A masterful guitarist and gifted storyteller, Osadebe developed a distinctive twist on highlife music, carving out a style uniquely his own. He also placed his Igbo heritage and moral values at the forefront of his music, this is unmistakably reflected in the culturally rich lyrics of his songs.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Lijadu Sisters</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Breaking away from the dominant juju, highlife, and apala sounds of the time, the Lijadu sisters; Taiwo and Kehinde Lijadu, were an Afropop duo who began their careers in the mid-60s but only soared to stardom in the early 70s. Their music, heavily influenced by jazz, rock, and funk, stood out for its distinctive sound. Singers, performers, and songwriters in their own rights, were known for their bold, sometimes political lyrics. The sisters confidently carved out a unique space for themselves in a heavily male-dominated industry. </span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Haruna Ishola</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Haruna Ishola, a leading figure in Apala music was credited with popularizing the genre and was highly active during the 1960s and is. He added a distinctive touch to the traditional Yoruba sound by blending his signature local instruments—the Shekere, Agogo bells, talking drums, and Agidibo—with Western instruments, creating a unique fusion that resonated with his broad audience.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Rex Lawson</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Cardinal Rex Lawson was a master trumpeter and a towering figure in the highlife music scene. He made an indelible mark on Nigerian music despite his untimely death at age 33 in 1971.  During his career, he recorded hundreds of songs, and his influence on the evolution of Nigerian music remains relevant even today. Decades later, his works continue to inspire generations of musicians.  Many of his tunes may sound familiar to contemporary listeners, a testament to his lasting influence on the Nigerian music industry, especially in the '60s and '70s. Lawson, known for his versatility, sang in multiple Nigerian languages and frequently infused his tracks with captivating alto saxophone solos.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A Playlist From the '6os</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Joromi - Victor Uwaifo</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Okpaku Elieli - Osita Osadebe</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Omo Jaiye Jaiye - Haruna Ishola</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ibinabo - Rex Lawson</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Guitar Boy - Victor Uwaifo</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Salome - I.K Dairo</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ije Enu - Celestine Ukwu</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Yellow Sisi - Rex Lawson</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Punctuality - Haruna Ishola</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Iya Mi Jowo - Lijadu Sisters</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sawale - Rex Lawson</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Conclusion</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While this list is far from exhaustive, I hope it has sparked your curiosity in the rich musical history of Nigeria. Perhaps you will dive deeper and discover your very own favorite '60s playlist. As mentioned earlier, this is just the beginning of many segments on the evolution of Nigerian music. I truly hope you enjoyed reading this as much as I enjoyed writing it.</span>",

    "title": "5 Tips on How To Maximize Your Royalties",
    "slug": "5-tips-on-how-to-maximize-your-royalties",
    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Before we dive in—and yes, I’ve said this once before—the fastest way to maximize your earnings in your music career is to ensure you are not leaving money on the table. Always have a legal representative in every negotiation to protect your interests. It is one of the smartest and most practical moves you can make. Before we talk about tips on how to maximize your royalties, let’s cover the basics of music royalties.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Royalties represent the revenue generated from the use, performance, and licensing of copyrighted work. In music, this covers both the master recording and the composition.  These payments go to copyright holders—essentially any individual, group, or legal entity with a stake in the work. I will not delve into the various </span><a href=\"https://royalti.io/2023/11/what-are-music-royalties/\"><b>types of royalties</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, as we already have a dedicated post on that topic, so be sure to check it out.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Maximizing Your Royalties</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Our tips on how to maximize your music royalties are not fail-proof, but they offer options worth exploring to help you be better positioned for maximizing your music career’s potential.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Get On Digital Platforms</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With the rise of digital music distribution, there is a significant shift in how we listen to music. Streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube offer a pay-per-stream model that monetizes fan appreciation and engagement. Essentially, the more streams your music receives, the more you earn. You can learn about </span><a href=\"https://royalti.io/2024/08/spotify-new-royalty-model-streaming-fraud/\"><b>Spotify’s new royalty model</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> from our previous posts. If you’re not already on a streaming platform, it might be worth considering joining one or two to expand your reach.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Social Media</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Streaming platforms are not the only source of royalties for artists. Social media platforms like TikTok also offer sync royalties when an artist’s music is used to create content within the app. Social media also provides an avenue for direct fan engagement. This allows artists to build and maintain their public personas while fostering a sense of personal connection with their audience. You might consider investing in your social media presence and employing effective strategies to boost online engagement and grow your popularity.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Understand Contracts</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">From record label and distribution contracts to </span><a href=\"https://royalti.io/2022/07/music-licensing-a-beginners-guide-to-licensing-your-music/\"><b>licensing agreements</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and split sheets, be sure to understand the terms of any document before you sign. When signing legal documents, simply being able to read and understand English is not enough. There are plenty of cautionary tales in the industry and it would be wise to learn from them. Remember that music is a business, and contracts cannot be 100% to your benefit alone. Agreements should be fair and mutually beneficial for all parties involved.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Music Publishing</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For artists who write their own lyrics, music publishing is worth considering. And no, </span><a href=\"https://royalti.io/2024/09/the-business-of-music-understanding-distribution-and-publishing/\"><b>music publishing is not the same as music distribution</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. With publishing, emphasis is placed on managing and monetizing the music composition specifically, the lyrics. This means that every time your lyrics are reproduced or integrated into any content or performance, royalties are generated and collected on your behalf.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Transparency In Royalty Tracking</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Maximizing your earnings is pointless, without proper royalty tracking. So, our final tip is to invest in platforms that prioritize royalty accounting and management. Tools like </span><a href=\"http://royalti.io\"><b>Royalti.io</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, offer a seamless way to monitor your earnings across streaming platforms and make sense of metadata collected from them.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And there you have it—five quick, practical strategies you can use to boost your earnings today.</span>",

    "title": "The Impact of AI In Music Production: Balancing Innovation and Authenticity",
    "slug": "the-impact-of-ai-on-music-creation-balancing-innovation-and-authenticity",
    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Music trends have always evolved. The way we make music today reflects how far innovation and ingenuity have shaped art over time. However, within the last few years, the pace of this evolution has accelerated drastically as AI, specifically generative AI, gains global traction. Within the music industry, its use is increasingly being integrated into the very fabric of the creative process. Today, you can easily find an artificial intelligence tool for basically any task. From generating melodies to mastering tracks to analyzing streaming algorithms. There are even tools that can create songs based on the emotions of the prompter. Safe to say, that the impact of AI in music production is not waning anytime soon. With investment and development continuing to expand across multiple industries, including music.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">AI In Music Production</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It is no surprise that there are now AI tools capable of handling the entire process of creating music. From mixing beats to producing polished mastered tracks within minutes—all from a few simple word prompts. These tools can compose entire pieces based on user inputs. Quality of the output aside, that itself is quite an impressive feat. As the days go by, more and more professionals are getting comfortable working with AI. It is being incorporated into various aspects of music creation and distribution. Some have developed methods that combine AI tools with human expertise rather than relying on AI completely. However they wish to use it, a quick Google search yields a vast array of options that users are often spoiled for choice.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That said, the quality of the AI-generated output will vary. This is because it often depends on the specific AI model and its training data.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Challenges And Ethical Concerns</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Some might argue that the use of assistive technology within the music ecosystem simply enhances and streamlines the creative process.  That its widespread use will in no significant way dilute authenticity. The argument is that the emergence of AI has, if nothing else, democratized the process of creating music. However, the reality is that anyone—a professional or even a 10-year-old, can now generate a song ready for streaming in just minutes by inputting a few prompts. Such songs can generate royalties from these streaming platforms. This creates an open door for unscrupulous actors to exploit this by flooding platforms with low-quality content and committing streaming fraud. This has led to issues with royalty distribution on said platforms, prompting streaming giants like Spotify to rethink their royalty distribution policies entirely.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Another concern is how these AI tools are trained, usually with data that may or may not be ethically sourced. Although some companies have established frameworks to avoid using copyrighted content, there are still those that remain unregulated. This raises the question of whether the final output, in this case, the song or lyrics, infringes on copyright.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How closely can AI-generated music resemble an existing work before it is considered a derivative of an artist's unique sound, style, or voice?</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Future Of AI and Music</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We can’t help but wonder if we are sacrificing authenticity and the human essence of creativity on the altar of speed and precision. A pertinent question is: how can we strike a balance between technological advancement and protecting the rights and interests of original creators?</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The discussion on the impact of AI-generated content in the music space endures. Many proposing solutions, from stringent copyright laws specific to AI-generated content to more transparent AI training methods to avoid unauthorized use of copyrighted materials. The consensus is, that maintaining originality and respecting intellectual property should be the foremost concern. </span>",

    "slug": "leveraging-international-collaborations-maximizing-royalties-for-nigerian-artists",
    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A glance at the Billboard Hot 100 entries for Nigerian artists reveals a subtle detail that might otherwise go unnoticed: the majority of these hits are collaborations and features with international artists. Now, we are not necessarily drawing any conclusions, Still, it does beg the question: Is the key to global success and recognition for Nigerian artists closely tied to international collaborations?</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A well-executed collaboration is gold; there is no doubt about that. Over the past five years, we have witnessed more international collaborations within the Nigerian Afrobeat scene. Of these projects, most have led to massive success, only a handful may have gone unnoticed. These collaborations have brought about significant commercial achievements, Grammy nominations, Grammy wins, and world tours, you name it. This week, we explore international collaboration as both a trend and a strategic tool that, if effectively leveraged, could maximize royalty earnings for Nigerian artists.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Understanding Music Collaboration</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To recap what a music collaboration is: it’s a level-based contribution, with each party expected to bring an aspect of their unique talent, style, or technique to the project. In collaborations, two or more artists work to create a piece of music together, each collaborator playing an equal or assigned part in the project. Collaborations are not limited to performers; they can involve songwriters, producers, et cetra. We have an additional resource that explores </span><a href=\"https://royalti.io/2024/10/music-collaboration-vs-feature/\"><b>collaborations and how they differ from features</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> if you would like to read that. </span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Rise of Afrobeats</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Collaborations are essentially partnerships, resulting in a co-created work where all parties have significant input. This arrangement also means that copyrights are shared and royalties are distributed amongst collaborators. Therefore, commercial success is mutually beneficial for everyone involved. In the last five years, we have seen an increase in the global appeal for Afrobeat. The genre has shifted from a “sounds by Africans for Africans” identity to being more internationally recognized. We’ve even seen K-pop acts try their hands at replicating the sound or experiment with afrobeat elements, but that’s a topic for another day. Additionally, Billboard's launch of the U.S. Afrobeats Songs chart in 2022, highlighted how much the genre has significantly gained traction in the U.S. market. </span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Leveraging International Collaborations</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With its increase in global appeal, the question became how Nigerian artists could best be positioned to capitalize on this expanding market. After all, if others are adapting your sound to fit their taste, it only makes sense that Nigerian artists take a stake in that process. Consequently, we have seen more cross-genre and cross-cultural collaborations, particularly with Western artists. Some of these popular and recent collaborations include:</span>\n\n<b>Essence</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> - Wizkid and Tems (a collaboration between Wizkid and Tems, the song was already a hit on the Billboard Hot 100 before the Justin Beiber feature)</span>\n\n<b>Wait For U</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> - Future, Tems, and Drake</span>\n\n<b>Talibans II</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> - Burna Boy and Byron Messia</span>\n\n<b>Calm Down</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> - Rema and Selena Gomez</span>\n\n<b>We Pray</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> - Coldplay, Burna Boy, and Little Simz</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Conclusions</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Now, to answer the question, does international recognition hinge on Nigerian artists’ ability to collaborate globally? We could say that there are no clear-cut answers. For example, success stories like Ckay’s ‘Love Nwantinti’ and Burna Boy’s ‘Last Last’ demonstrate that although collaborations amplify reach, a strong viral appeal can elevate a solo Nigerian song to international chart success. To this point, international recognition for Nigerian artists does not necessarily depend on their global collaborations. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, these instances are few and pale in comparison. When you look at the bigger picture, collaboration still seems like the surefire path to global success.</span>",

    "slug": "navigating-the-growing-demand-for-nigerian-music-in-the-diaspora",
    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">From Afrobeat to Amapiano to Highlife, African music has gained growing traction globally. As more people embrace the sound of African and Nigerian music, it is no surprise that the artists are also getting international recognition. Nigerian artists, in particular, are making waves internationally. Wizkid, Burna Boy, Tems, and Rema are celebrated for their unique styles and how they infuse their Nigerian identity in their music. Each of these artists represents others who have helped solidify Nigeria's place in the global music landscape. With achieving notable success on global music charts and securing international awards.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Projected Growth for Nigeria's Music Industry</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In Nigeria, the broader entertainment and media industry is </span><a href=\"https://www.pwc.co.za/en/press-room/africa-entertainment-media-utlook-2023-27.html\"><b>anticipated to grow significantly, with a compound annual growth rate of 16.5% from 2023 to 2027, potentially doubling in value to nearly $13 billion by 2027.</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> This will be primarily driven by digital expansion across various sectors like mobile media and digital advertising. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Meanwhile, the music streaming sector specifically is </span><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/digital-media/digital-music/music-streaming/nigeria\"><b>expected to grow at a rate of 14.9% annually from 2024 to 2027, reaching an estimated market volume of $107.40 million by 2027.</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> The music industry, both locally and internationally, has become a significant driver of </span><a href=\"https://kpmg.com/ng/en/home/media/press-releases/2021/07/the-business-of-entertainment-focus-on-the-nigerian-music-industry.html\"><b>youth employment and empowerment</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, fostering opportunities across the creative landscape.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So, what can other artists do to tap into this ever-growing demand for Nigerian music? What steps can they take to be part of this growth and successfully navigate the global music market?</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Navigating The Rising Demand For Nigerian Music</span></h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Digital Marketing And Branding </span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For an artist, building and maintaining a recognizable, consistent brand is essential; this gives audiences something to connect. Branding becomes even more crucial when sharing art with a global audience. Seeing as it requires an intentional approach and tailored marketing strategies. To this end, engaging professionals with expertise in brand management can be invaluable in ensuring an effective outreach.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Image is everything, especially in this digital era. Therefore, from establishing a strong </span><a href=\"https://royalti.io/2024/10/social-media-banter-the-strategic-power-of-controversy/\"><b>social media</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> presence to managing PR campaigns and advertising, investing in digital marketing can yield significant rewards. Today, social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok allow artists to reach fans worldwide, and even short video snippets of songs can go viral, serving as an unexpected gateway to success. </span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Streaming Platforms</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In this era of </span><a href=\"https://royalti.io/2024/09/the-business-of-music-understanding-distribution-and-publishing/\"><b>digital music distribution</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, artists need to have their music on streaming platforms. Not only does it make music accessible worldwide but also streamlines the process of royalty tracking and collection, helping artists monetize their work effectively. These platforms like Spotify also provide data on listener demographics and engagement, allowing artists to make informed marketing decisions. </span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Royalty And Catalog Management</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the quest to expand an artist’s reach and connect them with diverse audiences, it is important to manage royalties earned from multiple sources. This will ensure that artists are compensated accurately and minimize the risk of lost revenue. Alongside digital music distribution and streaming platforms, there are also music business solutions like </span><a href=\"http://royalti.io\"><b>Royalti.io.</b></a>  Solutions that<span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> help analyze revenue data pulled from different sources, offering artists a clear consolidated view of their earnings.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Collaborations</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Artists looking to expand internationally often </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1Qp6MXottSFbPYheuQ0A6NYlj88V-RHlLCxARYgAZtjw/edit\"><b>collaborate</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> with other artists, blending different styles and talents to create something unique, a potential hit song. Collaborating with artists from regions they aim to penetrate can enhance cross-cultural appeal. The song doesn’t need to be a new release; a remix featuring an artist from a target market can also mean new audiences.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Success in today’s music industry requires strategy and intentionality with every release, campaign, and piece of content. Focusing on engagement, and making it easy for fans to participate, are essential steps in building a lasting, global presence. Also, learning to leverage virtual events and live streams, and consistently networking. </span>",

    "title": "Balancing Artistry and Strategy: EPs vs. Singles in Today’s Music Market",
    "slug": "balancing-artistry-and-strategy-eps-vs-singles-in-todays-music-market",
    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While one allows the artist to showcase versatility without the pressure of a full album, the other generates visibility, fan engagement, and anticipation for larger projects. Artists use both EPs and singles to achieve different creative and commercial goals. We will explore their strategic impact, and how they are reshaping today’s music. What roles have we, by extended use, assigned to EPs and singles in today’s music market?</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Evolution Of Music Releases</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Before the proliferation of digital streaming, record labels would invest heavily in creating cohesive albums. Album concepts, sequencing, and storytelling all went into thoughtfully crafted full-length albums and helped to enhance the listener’s experience from start to finish. Although some artists still adhere to this tradition, the industry has changed significantly.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, we must admit that not every song in an album reaches hit status. There have always been listener favorites, and streaming platforms amplified this by allowing audiences to build personalized playlists from not just one album but multiple artists and albums. With access to vast music libraries, audiences could stream individual songs on demand. As a result, singles rose in prominence as we began to see a shift from album-driven sales. People no longer needed to purchase entire albums. The growth of streaming services, coupled with the influence of social media platforms, where fast, short content with snippets of songs were constantly being consumed, attention-grabbing tracks became highly profitable.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Defining EPs and Singles</span></h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">EPs</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">An EP (Extended Play) is a collection of works, typically 4-6 songs long with a playtime of about 15-30 minutes. Some call it a medium-length album, enough to showcase an artist's range and style without the full commitment of a long-form project. It is not enough to be considered an album but has more content than a single. Recent examples include Asake’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ololade Asake</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> (2022) and BTS Jimin’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Face (</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2023).</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Singles</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Singles, as the name implies, are individual tracks, that are sometimes released as promotional tools to gauge the audience reactions or to generate buzz for an upcoming album. A good example is Victony’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Holy Father</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Despite being a track on Mayorkun's album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Back in Office</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, it was promoted as a single with the intent of drawing attention to the album, and it worked like a charm. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With the proliferation of streaming culture and the use of social media platforms that thrive on short-form content, singles are crucial for achieving viral success, as illustrated by Latto’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Big Energy</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> (2021), which thrived on TikTok with its blend of pop and rap.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Strategic Benefits of EPs and Singles</span></h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">EPs</span></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Creative Flexibility:</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As stated earlier, EPs help an artist showcase versatility, encouraging creative experimentation without the financial investment of an album. There is also the time it takes to create a full album.  Releasing an EP can keep artists relevant, as they can put out new music without lengthy gaps.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Audience Building And Market Testing:</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Established artists use EPs to introduce new material or explore fresh directions in their music. EPs are also effective for introducing emerging artists. They provide a snapshot of an artist’s style and sound, attracting listeners who might not commit to a full album. Examples of successful debut EPs include Ayra Starr’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ayra Starr</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> (2021) and Ruger’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Pandemic</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Singles </span></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Streaming and Virality:</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Singles have always been utilized as an effective promotional tool and in the age of streaming, they are essential for gaining visibility. Propelled by streaming culture, Artists often release singles regularly to secure playlist placements on platforms like Spotify, increasing exposure and engagement. </span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Attention Grabbers:</span></h4>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Singles are designed as attention grabbers. Compared to EPs and full-length albums, singles are less expensive to produce, making them ideal for sustaining an artist's presence. Because they are more likely to go viral, they align perfectly with social media trends and the consumption patterns encouraged by the streaming ecosystem. Singles provide just the right leverage for playlist placement, enhancing listener engagement.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Conclusion </span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In this era of <a href=\"https://royalti.io/2024/09/independent-artists-music-distribution-tips/\"><strong>digital distribution</strong></a>, streaming is ultimately a game of numbers. As an artist, getting your song onto a major streaming playlist can significantly boost your reach. It is this playlist culture that has pushed artists to focus on releasing standout singles, as frequent releases increase the likelihood of getting noticed. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Incentivized to prioritize songs that could potentially dominate curated playlists, artists and labels have found themselves in a never-ending loop of constantly pushing out singles. As streaming and social media continue to shape music consumption, we will continue to witness within the music space a focus on virality rather than the artistic value that full-length albums represent reflecting our ever-evolving music landscape.</span>",

    "slug": "a-decade-of-rhythm-nigerian-music-in-the-70s",
    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The aftermath of Nigeria’s Civil War marked a pivotal moment in the country’s music scene. Juju music thrived in the West, while highlife music dominated the East due to the migration of many Eastern-origin highlife pioneers during the war. Post-war Nigeria, however, gradually embraced a more experimental musical landscape. This period saw the infusion of funk, soul, and Afrobeat into mainstream sounds. Despite these influences, one unifying theme prevailed: Nigerians skillfully blended global genres with their cultural and traditional elements, creating music that was distinctly their own. In many ways, the Nigerian music of the '70s was a product of experimentation.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This week, we delve into the rich and evolving music of the 1970s. As always, our exploration concludes with a carefully curated playlist for you.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While iconic </span><a href=\"https://royalti.io/2024/10/a-decade-of-rhythms-nigerian-music-in-the-60s/\"><b>1960s</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> artists like I.K. Dairo, Osita Osadebe, Victor Uwaifo, and Rex Lawson maintained their stardom across various genres, new musicians began to emerge, with sounds that were a little different from what was familiar.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Music of the '70s</span></h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Rise Of Igbo Highlife</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As highlife musicians concentrated in Eastern Nigeria, artists like The Oriental Brothers, Oliver de Coque, and Sir Mike Ejiagha developed a distinct Igbo highlife sub-genre. They infused traditional instruments, cultural themes, and Igbo-centric elements to resonate deeply with their audiences.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Oriental Brothers</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The group was formed in the late 1960s and included Godwin Kabaka Opara, Ferdinand Dan Satch, Emeka Opara, and Nathaniel Ejiogu. They became synonymous with Igbo highlife, and their popularity grew post-civil war influenced by traditional Igbo melodies and blended with lyrics of resilience and hope.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Oliver De Coque</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Oliver De Coque was known for incorporating the Ogene (a traditional instrument) in his performances and for his remarkable guitar technique. The Nnewi-born musician started his music career in the 1970s. He is hailed as the “Highlife King of Africa,” and produced an extensive catalog of albums that remain timeless party staples.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sir Mike Ejiagha</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nicknamed \"The Gentleman,\" </span><a href=\"https://royalti.io/2024/10/copyright-battles-in-music-insights-from-mike-ejeaghas-journey/\"><b>Sir Michael Nwachukwu Ejeagha</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> infused Igbo folktales into his music, offering moral lessons with every track. Starting his career in the 1960s, his influence extended into the 2000s, with younger generations rediscovering his music through social media virality.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Juju Music Refinement</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Juju music entered a new era in the 1970s with artists like King Sunny Ade introducing modern instrumentation, including electric guitars and synthesizers, creating a polished sound that appealed to local and international audiences.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">King Sunny Ade</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Born Sunday Adeniyi Adegeye, he began his career in the 1960s with Moses Olaiya’s Federal Rhythm Dandies. He revolutionized juju music with innovative sounds, earning Grammy nominations and global recognition as the \"King of Juju Music.\"</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nigerian Afrobeat</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The 1970s also marked the rise of Afrobeat, spearheaded by Fela Kuti. His Africa 70 band popularized this genre, which fused Yoruba rhythms with jazz and funk into a sound that is as timeless as it was revolutionary.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fela Kuti</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Olufela Olusegun Oludotun Ransome-Kuti formed his band Koola Lobitos in the 1960s. By the 1970s his music evolved to critique corruption and advocate for cultural pride. Fela’s socio-political lyrics often put him at odds with Nigerian authorities, but it was his fearless activism and unwavering advocacy that solidified his enduring legacy.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Funk And Soul Music</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The 1970s welcomed funk and soul into Nigerian music. Bands like The Funkees fused African rhythms with Western influences to create Afro-rock and funk-inspired sounds.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Funkees </span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">An Afro-rock band formed in the 1970s, The Funkees blended highlife, funk, and soul. Despite relocating to the U.K. in the '70s they retained their influence on the Nigerian music scene,  captivating audiences with their fusion of psychedelic rock and traditional Nigerian elements.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sweet Breeze</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sweet Breeze was a band active during the 1970s and early 1980s.

    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As a testament to the talent of African artists and the growing popularity of African music on the global stage, we have witnessed a surge in its worldwide influence. There has been a shift in the dynamics of music consumption in favor of African music. Indeed, it is no longer on the sidelines but has seized the spotlight and is demanding acknowledgment. From viral TikTok trends to Grammy nominations, the achievements of these talented men and women are indisputable.  </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With the rise of African music in global markets, what role can royalty management and royalty tracking platforms take on? How can they mitigate the challenges of royalty management for African artists? </span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Trends In African Music</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">From Afrobeats to Igbo pop, Highlife to Amapiano, African music rapidly establishes itself as a global force. Access to diverse genres, fueled by the proliferation of digital streaming platforms, has nurtured a hunger for authentic, culturally rich content. Flavour, Phyno, Tyla, Burna Boy, and Wasiu Ayinde Marshal each represent distinct sounds of African music, and these are just a few of the many promoting African music on the global stage. International collaborations have further propelled this growth, with Beyoncé’s 2019 album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Gift</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> serving as a prime example.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In 2023 alone, Nigerian artists earned a staggering $17 million in royalties from Spotify. Beyond Spotify, the accumulation of global revenues and increased streaming numbers show a growing worldwide appetite for African music. Digital platforms are tweaking their services and payment structures to serve their African audiences better. As more Africans gain access to these platforms, African artists get more support through the increase in local engagement. This growth spans multiple platforms and markets and indicates an increased earning potential for African artists. We see an upward trend that shows no signs of slowing down, a welcomed development in an industry increasingly recognized as a key driver of </span><a href=\"https://royalti.io/2024/11/navigating-the-growing-demand-for-nigerian-music-in-the-diaspora/\"><b>youth employment and empowerment</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Therefore, emphasis must be placed on the need for royalty management platforms like Royalti.io within the African music scene.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Challenges in Royalty Management</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">African music is a growing market, and so </span><a href=\"https://royalti.io/2024/11/leveraging-international-collaborations-maximizing-royalties-for-nigerian-artists/\"><b>leveraging this opportunity</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> requires more than just talent and creativity. Music is a business, and for artists to succeed, they must address the ever-present issue of tracking and managing royalties from multiple revenue streams.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Tracking Across Platforms</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Tracking a single release across multiple streaming platforms and compiling that data into one comprehensive report can be daunting. When revenue comes from various countries, differences in tax systems, copyright laws, and royalty collection mechanisms can complicate the process of collecting and reconciling payments.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Issues of Transparency</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Transparency in royalty management is essential, overtime issues arising from discrepancies between reported streams and actual earnings have become commonplace in the industry. Before the advent of royalty management platforms like </span><a href=\"http://royalti.io\"><b>Royalti.io</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, artists needed more means of verifying the accuracy of these reports. This lack of visibility created an environment ripe for misreporting and underpayment. </span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Undocumented Revenue Streams</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Revenue streams could go undocumented for several reasons, either from platforms failing to report streaming earnings or because income from live performances, licensing deals, and merchandising is not properly reconciled. These are a few of the ways artists could lose revenue. </span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Role Of Royalty Management And Royalty Tracking Platforms</span></h3>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ensuring Transparency</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Royalty management platforms address one of the most critical challenges faced by African artists: transparency. By centralizing streaming data while providing real-time insights into an artist’s earnings from various sources, these platforms grant artists and their teams access to critical financial data, in stark contrast to previous industry practices. </span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Simplifying Complex Revenue Streams</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">From streaming and live performances to sync licensing and merchandise sales, royalty management platforms aggregate revenue streams into a unified system. This simplifies otherwise complex financial data, helping artists and their teams make more informed decisions. This not only saves time but prevents revenue from slipping through the cracks.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Promoting Data-Driven Growth</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These platforms don’t just track royalties—they provide valuable insights that can shape an artist’s strategy. By analyzing revenue trends, artists and teams can identify growth opportunities that allow them to tailor their marketing efforts accordingly. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The solution to royalty management challenges faced by African artists lies in systems that centralize royalty tracking across multiple platforms. These systems offer transparency to an otherwise opaque process. The added benefit of simplifying contract management makes platforms like Royalti.io indispensable. By fostering trust and promoting clarity, transparent royalty management strengthens the relationship between artists, labels, and managers, thereby supporting the sustainability of the African music ecosystem.</span>",

    "title": "How Listener Preferences Shaped Music Trends and Royalties in 2024",
    "slug": "how-listener-preferences-shaped-music-trends-and-royalties-in-2024",
    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Music has a language of its own, transcending barriers, stirring emotions, and speaking directly to the soul. No matter who you are or where you come from, there’s a song for everyone. In 2024, as has always been the case, music continues to evolve in response to shifting listener preferences.  However, this time the changes are influencing not just what we hear but also how artists earn. For industry professionals, understanding music trends is important for maximizing creative and financial success.</span>\n<h3><b>Beats vs. Lyrics</b></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One ongoing discussion in the Nigerian music scene is the role of lyrical depth versus vibe-centric beats. Popular Afrobeat music provides a good example for this debate, thriving on infectious rhythms with minimal lyrical content. But, as the streaming numbers have shown, listeners “like it like that” as this approach seems to resonate with audiences.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This preference for beats over lyrics has created a market for trendy, high-energy songs that dominate playlists but often have a fleeting shelf life. However, there’s still a space for artists who balance captivating beats with thoughtful lyrics.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For artists, these trends pose an important question: how do you align your creative process with listener preferences while staying true to your unique voice? The answer often lies in understanding how your music performs in the real world, and that’s where data becomes invaluable.</span>\n<h3><b>Listener Preferences and Their Impact on Royalties</b></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Streaming platforms like Spotify provide insights into listener behavior. Spotify Wrapped, for instance, offers users a curated summary of their annual listening habits, including favorite artists, genres, and what Spotify calls a “listening personality.” For artists, these insights are more than a fun recap—they’re a roadmap to understanding their audience.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Listener preferences influence an artist’s royalty earnings. Regardless of lyrical depth, songs with high replay value often generate more revenue. On the other hand, tracks with meaningful lyrics and deeper emotional connections may foster long-term fan loyalty. These patterns offer insights into how artists can strategize their releases and promotional efforts.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Platforms like Royalti.io take this understanding further by providing real-time analytics on revenue streams. Artists and managers can see exactly where their income comes from and make data-driven decisions to optimize their careers. By leveraging these insights, artists can adapt to trends while staying true to their creative vision.</span>\n<h3><b>Respecting the Craft While Following the Numbers</b></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Music is personal, whether an artist prioritizes vibes or lyrical depth, their craft reflects a unique perspective. However, Music trends are more than fleeting phenomena—they reflect listener behavior, a driving force behind how royalties are earned. Recognizing what audiences respond to and how that translates into revenue is essential for sustained success so that artists can strike a balance between creative integrity and commercial success.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Whether you’re a manager, an indie artist, or a songwriter, let <a href=\"https://app.royalti.io/signup?ui=get-started\"><strong>Royalti.io</strong></a> help you navigate the complex world of royalties.

    "slug": "authenticity-in-music-how-cultural-narratives-drive-streaming-revenue",
    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There is a reason why </span><a href=\"https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-launches-netflix-fund-for-creative-equity-in-taiwan\"><b>Netflix</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> invests millions in commissioning content from diverse countries, telling stories from the perspective of those who have lived them. Similarly, </span><a href=\"https://artists.spotify.com/en/blog/behind-the-playlists-african-heat\"><b>Spotify</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> dedicates entire playlists celebrating top-performing African music on its platform. These companies recognize the undeniable link between cultural influences and streaming trends.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">From shaping content creation to nudging audience engagement, cultural narratives influence streaming revenue and quite significantly too. </span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Shaping listener preferences: Streaming Trends</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">At one point or another, we've all felt the satisfaction of discovering a movie or song that truly resonates with us. Perhaps, it is because the characters reflect our daily lives or we can relate to the lyrics. This is the same way cultural narratives rooted in traditions or social movements can forge deep connections with the audience. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, this connection does not stop at local listeners. When cultural narratives achieve global recognition, they unlock opportunities. For artists, this means opportunities to reach broader audiences and increase streams. The cultural storytelling and infectious rhythms of Afrobeats from Nigeria, the “Hallyu” K-pop wave from South Korea, and the global rise of South Africa’s Amapiano genre are examples of culturally influenced movements that transcend their origins to captivate worldwide audiences. In this way, cultural narratives influence on:</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Social Media And Viral Trends</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Streaming platforms have changed how content is consumed, shifting from a choice-driven process to one heavily influenced by social media virality. Trends on platforms like TikTok now play a significant role in shaping playlist placements and algorithm recommendations, giving priority to popular songs. Similarly, when a story or cultural movement goes viral, its revenue potential can increase drastically.  </span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Consumer Behavior</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Cultural narratives can shape consumer behavior. And while companies often exploit consumer culture to create new business opportunities, the bottom line is that popularity sparks demand. This demand goes beyond music to related products, experiences, and even lifestyle.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Why Cultural Narratives Matter</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So what makes cultural narratives so influential in streaming outcomes? Using the Afrobeat movement as an example, we will highlight how originality, resonance, and relatability have helped artists successfully incorporate their cultural identity into their music, building lasting connections with audiences.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Originality</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Afrobeat artists have found a niche in celebrating their uniqueness, crafting a sound that stands out globally, a blend of African rhythms with contemporary genres. Many of these songs are in local dialects or Pidgin English, yet this has not deterred international audiences in fact, it has become a strength. It is a positive nudge towards celebrating linguistic diversity proving that language is no barrier to music. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Take Wizkid's \"Ojuelegba,\" for instance. The song’s use of Yoruba makes it distinctly Nigerian while appealing to a universal audience. Songs like this, which represent elements of Nigerian culture, when placed on streaming platforms and introduced to international audiences create a thriving economy for Nigerian creatives. </span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Resonance</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Afrobeat artists have mastered the art of resonance, by crafting music that often speaks to universal themes like Black empowerment and cultural pride. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And for Nigerians, both at home and abroad,  the representation and international appreciation for their culture are empowering. This sense of identity fosters loyalty and promotes engagement, key factors in streaming platforms’ revenue models.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Relatability</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">By staying true to their roots and telling authentic stories, many songs reflect the real-life experiences of the African youth, making them relatable. Through storytelling, artists act as cultural ambassadors, sharing the narratives of their communities and forging emotional connections with listeners. For Africans living abroad, Afrobeats invokes a sense of nostalgia. This emotional bond strengthens fan loyalty, ensuring continued support for the music and the culture it represents. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Afrobeats artists have demonstrated that embracing cultural identity can be profitable. Their originality is a strength, and cultural authenticity remains their greatest asset, through creating music that resonates, they successfully turn listeners into dedicated fans.</span>",

    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The use of data within the music industry is often linked to the rise of digital music distribution, but this is quite far from the truth. Long before the digital era, data has always played a significant role in music. In the past, industry professionals relied on simple metrics like CD sales versus production costs or seasonal trends for concert planning. Today, the difference is not the need for data but rather the sophistication of how it is collected, analyzed, and applied.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To fully grasp streaming and its impact on music royalties, data analytics had to move toward the forefront of music production and distribution.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But First, What Is Data?</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In simple terms, data is a collection of information gathered and organized for a specific purpose. While its definition can be complex, this explanation captures its essence.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In music, </span><a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/articles/data-analytics\"><b>data analytics</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> – the process of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">collecting, transforming, and organizing data has uses far </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">beyond measuring an artist’s popularity. It plays a significant role in predicting hits, analyzing trends, and understanding listener behavior. </span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Role Of Data In Music Royalty Management</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Music royalty management ensures that artists, producers, and rights holders receive their fair share of earnings. When managing royalties, accurate data collection, reporting, and analysis are indispensable, this is because inaccurate data can mean missing out on revenue. </span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Royalty tracking</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Metadata is used across streaming platforms and social media to track song plays. By its nature, metadata serves as a digital fingerprint for music, containing essential details such as song title, artist name, record label, producer, and genre. The richer the metadata, the more efficient it is to track song usage. This, in turn, ensures accurate royalty distribution.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Measuring Algorithms/patterns </span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Streaming and social media platforms generate user data, revealing insights like which songs are trending, where they are most popular, and who is engaging with them. This information helps artists and labels understand audience demographics and preferences, allowing for better marketing and promotional strategies.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Decision making</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Streaming algorithms analyze factors like play count, repeat listens, and skip rates. This data helps to predict potential hits. By leveraging these insights, music professionals can refine promotional efforts and adapt to evolving industry trends.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Data Analytics Tools Like Royalti.io</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Effective royalty management hinges on reliable data and accurate metadata. Platforms like </span><a href=\"http://royalti.io\"><b>Royalti.io</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> simplify the complex process of royalty tracking and distribution. They provide a streamlined solution that helps music professionals take control of their earnings. By automating earnings reports, ensuring transparency, and streamlining data collection, these tools empower artists and rights holders to achieve transparency in royalty management. In today’s music landscape, data is not just an asset, but the foundation of fair and efficient royalty distribution. </span>",

    "title": "The Rise Of Nigerian female Artists And What that means For Music Royalties",
    "slug": "the-rise-of-nigerian-female-artists-and-what-that-means-for-music-royalties",
    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The phrase “the rise of Nigerian female artists” might suggest that the industry has always been male-dominated. But, a walk down Nigerian music history, reveals a legacy of songstresses, storytellers, and legendary voices who set the path for today’s trailblazers. From Onyeka Onwenu and Christy Essien-Igbokwe in the 1980s to Asa and Tiwa Savage in the 2010s, and now Tems and Ayra Starr, Nigerian female artists have, for generations, held their own. They stand shoulder to shoulder with their male counterparts. As African music’s global influence expands, they are slowly changing the narrative of success for African female musicians.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In 2022, Billboard U.S. launched its Afrobeat songs chart. Wizkid's collaboration with Tems on “Essence,” set a record with a 35-week tenure on the Billboard Hot 100, the longest ever for an African song, paving the way for Tems’ introduction to global audiences. </span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Business Side of Female Afrobeat</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Streaming platforms have changed how Nigerian female artists connect with audiences worldwide. Spotify's numbers tell an impressive story, Afrobeats streams on Spotify increased by 550% between 2017 and 2022. Nigerian female artists are soaring to new heights, yet their presence in the music industry still lags. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To bridge this gap, many are strategically leveraging digital tools and building their online presence through social media. They are taking on cross-cultural collaborations, and creating opportunities for themselves in spaces where their predecessors would be proud to see them thrive. This extends beyond Afrobeats, as female gospel artists continue to shape the Nigerian music scene, achieving both national and international acclaim.  </span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Breaking Barriers</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Despite this progress, Nigerian female artists still face challenges in securing the same opportunities as their male counterparts, while dealing with underrepresentation and limited industry support. Thankfully, this narrative is shifting. More female artists are capitalizing on streaming platforms to take ownership of their music earnings.  </span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Creating International Appeal</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Tems made history in 2023 as the first Nigerian female artist to win a Grammy for her collaboration with Future and Drake on </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Wait for U</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. She achieved another milestone at the 67th Grammy Awards. She won Best African Music Performance, reigniting the conversation about the growing opportunities for African female artists.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ayra Starr’s collaboration with Coldplay on Coldplay's </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Good Feelings</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> highlights the growing global interest in Nigerian talent. With every achievement comes a corresponding increase in revenue through royalties, performance rights, and licensing deals. But what does this mean for female artists’ long-term earnings?</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Role of Music Royalties in Their Success</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Unlike in the past, when revenue was heavily dependent on CD sales and live performances, female artists today have multiple avenues for earning royalties—from streaming and performance royalties to sync licensing. This ensures that an increase in an artist’s popularity directly boosts earnings. Tems’ Grammy win, for example, significantly increased her streaming numbers, leading to a substantial rise in her royalties.  </span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Changing the Narrative</span></h2>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Streaming and Digital Platforms</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Digital platforms have placed African artists on the global stage, sparking a digital revolution. Nigerian female artists now have direct access to international audiences, this has created opportunities for female artists to thrive independently, have greater creative control, and generate more revenue directly from their music.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Female-led Labels, Mentors and Initiatives</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There has been a significant rise in female music executives, producers, and managers. Many of them are spearheading initiatives to ensure the industry becomes more inclusive, offering networking, collaboration, and mentorship opportunities for female artists. </span><a href=\"https://www.audiogirlfoundation.org/advisoryboardmembers/\"><b>Audio Girl Africa</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> is one such initiative, with its aim to increase the representation of women in music production and sound engineering.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Role of Music Managers, Platforms, and Services in Supporting Female Artists</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Beyond record labels, music tech platforms like <strong><a href=\"http://Royalti.io\">Royalti.io</a></strong> are revolutionizing how female artists track and manage their earnings. By ensuring transparency in royalty distribution, helping artists track and collect royalties, and offering financial tools for music businesses, these platforms empower female artists to take control of their financial futures.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Future of Nigerian Female Artists and Music Royalties</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As the global demand for Nigerian music continues to grow, female artists are better positioned than ever to benefit. By leveraging available tools, they can secure fairer royalty structures, improved streaming rates, and stronger publishing rights.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With global achievements, increased royalty earnings, and greater industry influence, one can say that these signs point to a new era in music royalties, one where Nigerian female artists take their rightful place at the top.</span>",

    "slug": "a-decade-of-rhythm-nigerian-music-in-the-80s-part-1",
    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Nigeria of the “80s was a fascinating era for music. As a people, we became increasingly open to cross-cultural interactions, within Africa and beyond. These interactions left an impression evident in mainstream music and helped shape its evolution. As cultures from the West and other regions flooded major Nigerian cities, they left an indelible mark on our musical landscape. Additionally, Nigerian music of the '80s saw the diffusion of an otherwise male-dominated music industry, as more women pursued successful singing careers, securing their places in music history.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Our music also made waves internationally, with individual achievements such as King Sunny Ade's \"Juju Music\" reaching Billboard's \"Pop Albums\" chart. We had hit after hit that dominated the airwaves, and I am very excited about our curated playlist at the end of this post.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Blasts From The Past</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Most artists from the '60s and '70s retained a stronghold on popularity during the ‘80s. King Sunny Ade, </span><a href=\"https://royalti.io/2024/10/a-decade-of-rhythms-nigerian-music-in-the-60s/\"><b>Haruna Ishola</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, Ebenezer Obey, Chief Osita Osadebe, </span><a href=\"https://royalti.io/2024/10/a-decade-of-rhythms-nigerian-music-in-the-60s/\"><b>Oliver De Coque</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, and Victor Uwaifo remained relevant</span><b>.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> They were also those whose fame transcended their passing, leaving a legacy that still endures today, Rex Lawson And Celestine Ukwu to mention a few.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The decade carried forward the brilliance of the 1970s. Juju music, Highlife, Akwete, and Apala remained popular, even with the emergence of new voices and styles, and is a testament to the mastery of their legendary pioneers. </span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Still The Battle Of The Bands</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The culture of band music did not disappear in the 1970s. In fact, the number of bands seemed to increase, with their music readily available to delight audiences. Performing in nightclubs and bars, nightlife thrived in big cities like Lagos, Enugu, and Port Harcourt, proving that live instrumentation was here to stay. With elaborate stagecraft and extended instrumental solos, bands constantly competed for the attention of adoring fans.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Peacocks International band</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Peacocks International Band was a dominant force in the Nigerian music scene during the ‘70s and ‘80s, producing timeless classics that remain popular today. This prolific Igbo highlife group, which emerged in the early 1970s, was known for its melodious music, deeply rooted in Igbo storytelling and social commentary.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Afrobeat Popularity </span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Although Fela Kuti is credited with revolutionizing Nigerian Afrobeats, a genre he popularized in the late ‘70s through the ‘80s, he was notably not the only player on the scene. Beyond Fela’s political and social activism through Afrobeats, musicians like Shina Peters and Sonny Okoson also contributed their unique interpretations of the genre, using their talent to make a difference.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sonny Okosun</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sonny Okosun was a singer, guitarist, and composer who passed away in 2008. He was, by every indication, a legend in his own right—an advocate for social and political change, through what many have termed \"musical activism.\" He left behind an impressive collection of songs still loved and listened to today.</span>",

    "content": "<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">An Ode To The Songstresses Of The '80s</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the '80s, Nigerian music witnessed a commendable influx of female artists into the music industry. Across various genres, these women made their mark. From the <a href=\"https://royalti.io/2024/12/a-decade-of-rythym-nigerian-music-in-the-70s/\"><strong>Lijadu Sisters</strong></a>, who had established themselves in the '70s and sustained their influence into the '80s, to newer voices that emerged possessing unique sounds and distinctive voices.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Salawa Abeni</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Salawa Abeni is credited with popularizing Waka music, a genre she put her spin on by blending the Yoruba music tradition with elements of modern pop. With an extensive body of work, she remains an active performer to this day.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Christy Essien-Igbokwe</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Nigerian “Lady of Songs” was admired for her voice, talent, and lifelong contributions to the entertainment industry. Born on November 11, 1960, Christy was a musician, songwriter, and actress. She sang in multiple languages and was also the first female president of the Performing Musicians Association of Nigeria (PMAN). She passed away in 2011.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Onyeka Onwenu</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A close contemporary of Christy Essien-Igbokwe was the legendary Onyeka Onwenu, known as “The Elegant Stallion.” These female voices bravely carved out a niche for themselves in a male-dominated industry. Sadly, Onyeka Onwenu passed away in 2024, but her legacy of timeless songs and service ensures she remains in the hearts of Nigerians.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">African Stars</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nigeria is well known for appreciating artistic excellence, regardless of where an artist is from. As long as an artist was talented, they found a warm welcome among Nigerian audiences. This was also true of the ‘80s, as the Nigerian music scene wasn’t just shaped by local legends, African artists from beyond the country’s borders contributed to mainstream music. </span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Angelique Kidjo</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Long before she gave us her rendition of \"We Are One\" from </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Lion King</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, Angelique Kidjo was a notable presence on Nigerian radio airwaves. Born to a Yoruba mother and a Fon father, the Beninese artist started her music career in the early 1980s with the release of her debut album, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Pretty</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. She would go on to achieve global fame, collaborating with younger artists across Africa in the mid-2000s and beyond.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Salif Keita</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Malian singer-songwriter was known for his distinctive style of Afro-pop dance music, a fusion of jazz, blues, and traditional Mande rhythms that made him popular in the ‘80s.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ebo Taylor</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A Ghanaian musician and composer, Ebo Taylor were instrumental in fusing highlife and Afrobeat with jazz and funk.

We’ve previously explored the complexities of digital music distribution and how streaming fraud may have necessitated a policy overhaul for one of the </span><a href=\"https://royalti.io/2024/08/spotify-new-royalty-model-streaming-fraud/\"><b>world’s biggest streaming platforms</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Now, we will break down how streaming fraud affects music professionals across the board and share the best strategies to navigate this challenge and ultimately protect catalogs from exploitation.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Before we begin, it’s important to acknowledge that there is no blueprint for protecting your life’s work against fraudsters. However, by implementing practical, proactive strategies, you can minimize risks and protect your streams, but you must continuously refine your approach.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Understanding Streaming Fraud</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Streaming manipulation takes many forms, from fraudsters who use automated bots to repeatedly play songs, artificially inflating stream counts, to click farms where networks of devices generate fake streams, mimicking real listener engagement.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There’s also impersonation, identity theft, account hacking, and playlist manipulation. In essence, streaming fraud refers to any activity where deceptive tactics are used to boost numbers, royalties, or playlist placements.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To combat this, most streaming platforms employ detection systems to monitor fraudulent activities. These include flagging accounts that stream music nonstop for 24 hours, identifying suspicious playlists with abnormally high engagement rates, and tracking unexplained spikes in follower counts.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, fraudsters continuously adapt, making the fight against streaming fraud a constant tug-and-pull situation. The rise of </span><a href=\"https://royalti.io/2024/11/the-impact-of-ai-on-music-creation-balancing-innovation-and-authenticity/\"><b>AI-generated content</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> has further complicated matters, introducing new concerns that demand urgent attention. In response, streaming platforms tightened their anti-fraud measures, implementing stricter verification processes and advanced monitoring systems to protect legitimate artists and ensure fair revenue distribution.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How to Protect Your Music Catalog</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As streaming platforms </span><b>utilize fraud detection tools</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to analyze listening patterns and flag suspicious activity. It has become imperative for artists and labels to also take proactive steps to safeguard their catalogs.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One crucial step is to </span><b>regularly monitor streaming data </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">for anomalies. A sudden increase in engagement, especially without any marketing or promotional efforts, should raise red flags. Consider keeping a detailed record of all promotional activities to help you distinguish legitimate from fraudulent streams.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Royalty management platforms like </span><a href=\"http://royalti.io\"><b>Royalti.io</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> provide real-time data analytics, making it easier to track unusual activity and document potential fraud.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Additionally, </span><b>avoid services that promise guaranteed streaming numbers</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, as these often involve fraudulent tactics; instead, focus on </span><b>organic audience growth</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> by engaging with legitimate promotion services and maintaining ethical marketing practices.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Also, </span><b>routinely audit your playback data</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and report any suspicious trends to your distributor or streaming platform. Staying vigilant and acting swiftly can help prevent long-term damage to your catalog.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Conclusion</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With digital streaming comes significant opportunities for artists to increase their earnings, but it also poses new risks, streaming fraud being one of the most pressing. While fraudsters are constantly refining their tactics, music professionals must remain proactive in protecting their primary source of income.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">By understanding common fraud patterns, implementing preventive strategies, monitoring streaming analytics, swiftly reporting suspicious activity, and maintaining thorough promotional records, artists can significantly reduce their exposure to fraud. </span>",

    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">By offering a comprehensive cloud-based solution that simplifies music royalties and catalog management, Royalti.io is changing how music professionals approach royalty tracking and <strong><a href=\"https://royalti.io/2025/01/how-data-analytics-transforms-music-royalty-management/\">data analytics</a></strong>. This platform streamlines royalty management through automated tracking, real-time financial breakdowns, and intuitive catalog organization. Royalti.io is lauded for its ability to handle everything from contract management to royalty distribution—all from a single, secure dashboard. It’s little wonder that artists, producers, and music companies are ditching spreadsheets and making the transition to digitalized and sustainable solutions. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So <strong><a href=\"https://royalti.io/2024/09/10-reasons-to-use-royalti-io/\">why are pros switching to Royalti.io?</a></strong> </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We will explore why music professionals are opting for the ultimate royalty management solution, highlighting its key features and <strong><a href=\"https://royalti.io/2024/12/the-role-of-royalty-management-and-royalty-tracking-platforms-in-the-african-music-industry/\">benefits</a></strong> and how it's revolutionizing the management of music royalties and accounting.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Understanding Royalty Management</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">At the risk of sounding repetitive, the streaming era has fundamentally altered how music royalties work, particularly how they are earned and collected. The most common payment model for streaming platforms operates on a pro-rata basis, where revenue from subscriptions and advertisements is pooled and distributed based on each artist's share of total streams. In addition to album sales, artists now receive cumulative payments per stream on platforms like Spotify.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But this model is not without its complexities. For example, because revenue is earned per stream, each payment is accumulated over a specified period, often requiring millions of streams to generate substantial income. The global reach of streaming services also complicates royalty distribution with varying laws and rates across different countries. As a result, income is often unpredictable, and artists rarely know exactly how much they’ll earn at any given time. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The complexity of modern royalty management extends well beyond streaming. Artists today must navigate multiple revenue streams, including mechanical royalties and sync licensing fees. First among the rising concerns is the lack of transparency in the collection and distribution of royalties, prompting many artists to seek direct control over their royalties. There's also the issue of metadata accuracy. Incomplete or incorrect metadata can lead to lost or misallocated royalties. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To address these challenges, the industry is increasingly turning to technological solutions. Cloud-based royalty management systems that can process millions of lines of data and produce statements in minutes rather than weeks offer much-needed transparency in royalty reporting.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Features of the Royalti.io Platform</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Royalti.io offers a centralized repository that serves as a secure vault for all music assets, enabling straightforward organization. The platform boasts an intuitive interface, where users can organize artist assets, metadata, and release information. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Its contract management system stands out for its thoroughness. Users can create and manage digital versions of virtually any type of music business contract and establish detailed royalty splits. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The platform automates royalty calculations based on pre-agreed split terms while simultaneously tracking advances, expenses, and payments linked to specific artists or assets.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Users can access detailed reports on royalty earnings across various revenue streams and integrate with accounting tools to review production and marketing expenses. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Royalti.io also provides real-time analytics on streaming performance and audience demographics. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Strict access controls give users full authority over who can access what data, allowing them to grant specific permissions to team members as needed.

Through this user-friendly interface, they can track accrued royalties, monitor payments, and analyze trends without needing any technical expertise.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Making the Switch to Royalti.io</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In an era where royalty management is riddled with complexities, Royalti.io stands out as a practical solution, bringing together essential tools for catalog organization, financial tracking, and rights management on a single, streamlined platform.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Once onboard, the workspace becomes your central hub for managing artists and users.

    "slug": "why-nostalgia-is-powering-the-re-emergence-of-older-music",
    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Only a rookie thinks that trends are but a season; the OGs know that trends come and go, only to swing right back full circle. They might be repackaged, dressed up, and called by another name, but trends always return. It's kind of like digging through your parents’ wardrobe, finding something, and thinking, “Yeah, I can make this work,” wearing it to an event, and then a week later, everyone is rocking their father’s trousers. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But what is the psychology behind the re-emergence of old trends, especially old music that streaming giants are willing to bet real money on it? </span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A Blast From The Past: Why Old Music Is Trending Again </span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">By the late 2024, music streaming platforms made an intriguing reveal: old playlist favorites are making a comeback. From music as far back as the 1960s to the more recent hits of the 2010s. If you’re on TikTok or any social media platform focused on video and audio content, this observation would not come as a surprise. If we’re being completely honest, oldies have been the vibe for a while now and they’re not going anywhere.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But let’s all pretend to be shocked for a second, gasp in disbelief, and say “No, you don’t mean it!” </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So what is driving this shift in listener preferences? Why are these classic hits popular again? Nostalgia? Emotional resonance? A craving for more meaningful lyrics? Probably a mix of all three.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Through features like Spotify Wrapped, we can see just how much listener choices can significantly affect artists’ earnings. And shifts like the resurgence of older music are already affecting royalty streams. What does that mean for artists and the music industry as a whole?</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How Streaming Platforms Are Reviving Classic Hits</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Most music streaming platforms have transformed old catalogs into active, revenue-generating assets. On the Nigerian music scene, for example, you will find digitized versions of classic tracks from the ‘60s, ‘70s, and ‘80s on platforms like YouTube. As these old catalogs are brought back to life, there is growing concern over whether these versions are being handled by the rightful owners, and whether streaming income is getting back to the original creators.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But the fact is, there’s a healthy demand for music many thought was long forgotten. During the pandemic, </span><a href=\"https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-04-14/spotify-listeners-are-getting-nostalgic-behavioral-science-writer-david-disalvo-and-cyndi-lauper-share-why/\"><b>Spotify</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> reported a 54% increase in searches for 'oldies' and 'throwback' playlists, demonstrating the growing appetite for these songs.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are also streaming algorithms on these platforms that suggest “next plays” based on a person's listening habits. And so, these songs are placed in front of those who are most likely to stream them. Additionally, there is playlisting, landing on a popular playlist can catapult a song, old or new, back into the spotlight. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And let’s not forget social media. Virality culture is breathing new life into otherwise forgotten tracks. Turning them into trending sounds and viral sensations by incorporating them into social media content.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What this means For Artists, Listeners, And The Music Industry</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Streaming has completely rewritten music's life cycle. Previously, once a song faded after initial popularity, you had to intentionally seek it out to preserve it for personal enjoyment. Now, with streaming platforms, those songs remain infinitely accessible, able to earn royalties and stay relevant indefinitely.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Music catalogs have also become more attractive to investors. With recurring subscription fees and steady streaming income, these once-dormant tracks now promise consistent royalties, something almost impossible in the pre-streaming era.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The importance of catalog management is brought to the forefront once again. Artists and rights holders must ensure their catalog information is accurate and up-to-date, especially for older works. They can take advantage of catalog management solutions like </span><a href=\"http://royalti.io\"><b>Royalti.io</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to achieve this. Doing so ensures that older works are ethically available on streaming platforms and that royalties from sync deals or streaming go where they belong.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nostalgia is Here to Stay</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Music, by its very nature, is timeless. A quote from Sergei Rachmaninoff, a Russian composer and pianist, says, “Music is enough for a lifetime, but a lifetime is not enough for music.” </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The re-emergence of older music proves that great songs never truly go out of style. There’s something about music acting as a key to memory, unlocking emotions and moments we’ve tucked away in the recesses of our minds—that’s the power of nostalgia.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As listeners seek comfort and connection, nostalgia is here for the long haul, and it’s a powerful driver of streaming trends. For artists or record labels, now might be the perfect time to sample or revisit that old-school track you’ve been eyeing since. Who knows? You might just help a new generation rediscover its magic.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A song you’ve heard a thousand times might still have something new to say.</span>",

    "title": "What is Royalty Management Software? A Plain English Guide for Creators",
    "slug": "what-is-royalty-management-software-a-plain-english-guide-for-creators",
    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The very notion of royalty management is to ensure the accurate distribution and protection of royalties. Managing music royalties is particularly complex due to the numerous revenue streams, with streaming becoming a highly profitable addition. There are misallocated royalties, delayed payments, and a lack of transparency, that posed challenges for the industry. Automated calculations, real-time financial breakdowns, and transparent reporting, this is how royalty management software is transforming the game for music professionals.  So let’s discuss. </span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What is Royalty Management</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As mentioned earlier, royalty management is a critical aspect of the music business that ensures artists, songwriters, producers, and rights holders receive fair compensation for their work. This process involves tracking, calculating, and distributing royalties from every single revenue source, including: </span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Streaming Services:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, etc.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Digital Downloads:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> iTunes and similar platforms</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Performance Royalties:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Earned when music is played on radio, TV, or in public venues.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Mechanical Royalties:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Generated from the reproduction of music through CDs, vinyl, and digital formats.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Sync Licensing Fees:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Paid when music is used in movies, commercials, video games, or social media content. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Efficiency, accuracy, and transparency are the hallmarks of royalty management. And so, when selecting music royalty management software, there are features that you must look out for. </span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Challenges in Royalty Management</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Traditional royalty management had many challenges, including delayed payments, lack of transparency, and frequent disputes over earnings, with many artists and rights holders believing they received less than was due. Because of the multiplicity of revenue sources, reconciling different reports and payment structures became a logistical nightmare. Common errors included manual data entry mistakes,  typos, formatting inconsistencies, and missing information.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Even with digital music distribution, royalty management still encounters significant hurdles, particularly in metadata accuracy. Incomplete or incorrect metadata makes matching tracks to their rightful owners impossible. This results in unclaimed earnings, and payments being sent to the wrong artists, labels, or publishers. The term \"black box\" royalties describe these unclaimed royalties that sit in limbo due to mismatched data, an issue that could be avoided by utilizing royalty management software. </span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What Royalty Management Software Does</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Music professionals need a centralized hub to track and manage their earnings. Royalty management software simplifies this by automating time-consuming tasks, allowing professionals to focus on their creative work rather than financial administration. Imagine minimizing hours of manual sales data processing to mere minutes, eliminating error-prone spreadsheets, and replacing them with an intelligent system that automatically validates sales against contract terms and immediately flags discrepancies.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Beyond royalty tracking, these platforms offer financial clarity. They generate detailed royalty statements, breaking down earnings by source; streaming, downloads, physical sales, and sync licenses, while providing detailed financial reports that highlight both revenue earned and expenses owed.

    "title": "A Decade Of Rhythm: Nigerian Music in the 90s",
    "slug": "a-decade-of-rhythm-nigerian-music-in-the-90s",
    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What made the music of the ‘90s so great? Perhaps it was the reggae rhythms on every radio station or maybe it was the gradual yet undeniable rise of hip-hop capturing the hearts of the younger generation. Also, it was the ‘90s, which marked a significant shift in how music was consumed.  As cassettes and CDs (especially in the latter half of the decade) began to replace vinyl records, and more people had increased access to music beyond nightclubs and live performances, the Nigerian entertainment industry’s economic potential started to come into focus. Older songs were re-released or distributed as CDs and cassettes, allowing many '80s and '70s hits to maintain a presence on the airwaves. It is against this backdrop, a chaotic harmony of sound and rhythm, that we introduce you to Nigerian music of the ‘90s. </span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Music in the ‘90s</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">By the mid-'90s, hip-hop had cemented its place in Nigerian pop culture, introducing us to artists like Tony Tetuila, Eedris Abdulkareem, and Eddy Montana. It was a politically charged era in Nigeria, and as social activism became more prominent, politically driven songs resonated with audiences. There was never a better time for Fela’s music as Afrobeat remained a powerful medium for social commentary. And that theme reverberated nationally. Nigerian musicians continued to challenge societal norms and speak out through their art, despite the repressive atmosphere of the Abacha regime. </span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Genres</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There had never been a more thriving era for reggae music in Nigeria than the 90’s. Remember that social commentary we mentioned earlier? Reggae artists boldly used their lyrics to rock the boat and question authority.  Afrobeat, also thrived, not only with established pioneers holding the reins but also with newer artists like Lagbaja adding a fresh perspective. The era also saw the rise of street music, hip-hop, and R&amp;B giving way to the Nigerian music industry as we know it today. </span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Musicians</span></h3>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Evi-Edna Ogholi</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you were born in the ‘90s, chances are that Evi-Edna Ogholi’s rendition of the birthday song was played over and over again at your first birthday party. Her most popular hits include “Happy Birthday,” “Obaro,” and “Ririovara”. A trailblazer in the male-dominated reggae scene, Edna’s unique choice to perform in her native Isoko dialect set her apart. Her timeless music is a testament to how much dedication she sowed into her work. </span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Weird MC</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Adesola Idowu popularly known as Weird MC, made bold statements with singles like \"Allen Avenue\" and \"Ijoya.\" Her debut album, \"Simply Weird,\" released in 1996, showcased her fresh, unapologetic approach to music. Collaborating with both Nigerian and international artists, she influenced the music scene well into the 2000s.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lagbaja</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bisade Ologunde famously known as Lagbaja, became a symbol of Afrobeat’s evolution, with many drawing a parallel between him and Fela. Armed with his saxophone and the talking drum and his profound, socially charged lyrics.  His mysterious persona, marked by his iconic mask, made him a cultural fixture from the '90s into the 2010s.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Majek Fashek </span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nigerian reggae musician and guitarist Majekodunmi Fasheke rose to fame in the late 1980s. Known for his passionate calls for unity and social change, Majek’s music reflected the struggles of ordinary Nigerians, a message that understandably resonated with his audience. He died in 2020, leaving behind a legacy of unabashed truth steeped in melody. </span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Daddy Showkey</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">John Odafe Asiemo better known as Daddy Showkey is very vocal about his background and humble beginnings. Advocating the idea that, in spite of adversity, anybody can rise to a place of grace and success. His style of music can be best described as a blend of Reggae and Afrobeat music combined with relatable storytelling.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> As a solo artist, his breakthrough came in 1994, following his time with the \"Pretty Busy Boys.\"</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Foreign influences</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Throughout the '90s, Nigerian music embraced diverse influences, foreign artists like Bob Marley, Brenda Fassie, Celine Dion, and Michael Jackson remained very popular alongside homegrown talents. Despite the absence of the internet or social media, their influence was still notable. Their music, ever so present on the airwaves, inspiring Nigerian artists to push boundaries.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Sound That Shaped a Generation</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Isn’t it said; that great art often emerges from adversity? Whether through Majek Fashek's politically charged lyrics or Daddy Showkey’s dance moves, they showed us that music could be both entertainment and a powerful tool for social commentary. These songs continue to inspire artists today, reminding us of the enduring creativity and resilience of Nigerian musicians. </span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Our '90s Playlist </span></h2>\nAnd finally the <a href=\"https://app.royalti.io/signup?ui=get-started\">Royalti.io</a> '90s playlist.\n<ol>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Lagbaja - </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Coolu Temper</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Onyeka Onwenu - </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One Love</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Bob Marley - </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Redemption Songs</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Brenda Fassie - </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Vuli Ndlela</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Evi-Edna Ogholi -</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Happy Birthday</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Sunny Okosun - </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">African Soldiers</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Daddy Showkey - </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Diana</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Majek Fashek - </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So Long</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Pretty Busy Boys - </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Big Belle</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Bob Marley - </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Could You Be Loved</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Brenda Fassie - </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nomakanjani</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Remedies - </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Shako Mo</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Bongos Ikwue - </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Still Searching</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Evi-Edna Ogholi - </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Obaro</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Majek Fashek - </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Religion Is Politics</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Daddy Showkey - </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Congratulations</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Brenda Fassie - </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Wedding Day</span></li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;",

    "title": "Music Royalty Collection in Nigeria: Laws, Challenges and Solutions",
    "slug": "music-royalty-collection-in-nigeria-laws-challenges-and-solutions",
    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Explain the concept of music royalty collection in Nigeria; how royalty can be collected, and identify the parties responsible for this process. Address the challenges that hinder effective royalty collection and how technology could offer lasting solutions. That is the core of today's discussion.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Let’s begin by defining what royalties are, and also the </span><a href=\"https://royalti.io/2023/11/what-are-music-royalties/\"><b>different types of music royalties</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What are royalties</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Royalties are revenue earned from the authorized use, licensing, and exploitation of copyrighted work. The person entitled to royalties is the copyright holder. Let’s take a quick detour to examine the fundamentals of copyright, with specific attention to the Nigerian Copyright Act of 2022.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Copyright</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">According to Nigerian copyright laws, creative works must be fixed in a medium of expression. One that allows the work to be perceived, reproduced, or communicated, either directly or with the help of any machine or device. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Copyright allows exclusive rights to the creator(s) of the work. And unless these rights are assigned or licensed to another party, no one else has the authority to exploit the work. There’s no requirement of formality for creative works to be eligible for copyright; protection is automatic upon creation.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In music, copyright protection covers two components: the composition which includes (melodies, lyrics, and chords) and the sound recording. In the first case, copyright lasts for the creator’s lifetime and 70 years after their death. For the second, copyright lasts for 50 years after the recording was first made available to the public. </span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Music Royalties</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Going back to the focus, music royalties and royalty collection in Nigeria. There are several types of music royalties, each corresponds to different forms of music usage and benefits particular rights holders. </span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Performance Royalties</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: It is earned when music is publicly performed, played, or publicly streamed.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Mechanical Royalties:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> It is generated when music is reproduced or distributed, whether in physical form (vinyl, CDs) or digitally (digital downloads, streams). </span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Synchronization Royalties</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: (Sync licensing fees) It is paid when music is paired with visual media such as films, commercials, video games, or social media content.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Print Royalties:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> It is generated from the distribution of sheet music and lyrics, and is especially relevant for composers and songwriters.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Royalty Collection Pathways</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Each type of music royalty matches a different use for music, and therefore, distinct collection mechanisms. Whether set by law or developed for efficiency, these systems are created to ensure comprehensive revenue tracking.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Most royalties are collected directly by the artists, record labels, or distributors. For instance, income from streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, the responsibility of negotiating and granting licenses, and collecting and distributing royalties, is assigned under Nigerian copyright law to Collective Management Organisations (CMOs).</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Collection Management Organisations (CMO)</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Collective Management Organisations (CMO) are organizations licensed by the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nigerian Copyright Commission (NCC) to collect royalties on behalf of rights holders. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you are unfamiliar with the NCC</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, it is the commission charged with regulating copyright matters in Nigeria.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Artists who wish to be represented by a CMO must be registered with one. Thus, granting it authority to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">license their works and collect royalties on their behalf</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CMOs typically negotiate license fees with users of copyrighted content.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Currently, two CMOs operate in Nigeria for music royalties. The Copyright Society of Nigeria (COSON) and the Musical Copyright Society of Nigeria (MCSN). </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, there is an ongoing dispute between these two organizations. This continues to raise questions about which one holds the license to act as the sole CMO for musical works and sound recordings.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So, do Nigerian artists need to register with a CMO? While registration with a CMO is not mandatory, it is recommended for Nigerian artists to maximize their royalty collection since registration guarantees representation. Additionally, membership provides access to both local and international royalty collection networks.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Challenges</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The legal dispute between COSON and MSCN reflects broader issues within Nigeria’s royalty collection framework. And the NCC, for its part, appears to favor a single CMO system for each category of copyrights. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, this system reduces choices for artists seeking representation not just in Nigeria but in international spaces as well. Also it reduces healthy competition that could otherwise bring about improvements in transparency, efficient operations, and accountability in the royalty collection process. </span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Conclusion</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CMOs must earn and maintain the trust of the rights holders they represent. Adopting a tech-driven approach could enhance transparency and accountability by introducing digital tools for accurate tracking, such as metadata analysis for real-time royalty traceability.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Additionally, more artists need to be to be informed and actively involved in the royalty collection process.</span>",

    "slug": "music-royalties-blockchain-regulation-nigerias-investment-and-securities-act-2025",
    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To update Nigeria's capital market rules to match global standards, keep up with changes within this sector in the past 18 years, protect investors better, and make the market more transparent, Nigeria's Investment and Securities Act of 2025 (ISA) was signed into law in March 2025. It replaces the Investments and Securities Act of 2007. Although a welcome development for Nigeria’s capital market, our focus today is on how this legislation might redefine the way Nigerian artists earn and diversify their music royalties.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Unfolding Legal Status of Digital Assets in Nigeria</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nigeria’s stance on digital assets has undergone quite a transformation. From the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) issuing warnings about the risks of cryptocurrency use and its potential for illicit use, to an outright ban in 2021, the country seemed to be closing the door on virtual currencies.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, between 2023-2024, there was a gradual easing of policies, as guidelines were introduced for Virtual Asset Service Providers. And in 2025, a law that expressly recognizes digital assets as securities.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Digital Assets as Securities</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With this new law, digital assets are now considered securities. This includes cryptocurrencies, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and tokenized assets. Automatically placing virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), Digital Asset Operators (DAOPs), and Digital Asset Exchanges under the regulatory scope of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This means platforms involved in </span><a href=\"https://royalti.io/2023/11/how-blockchain-technology-is-redefining-the-future-of-music-royalty-management/\"><b>blockchain</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> technology, crypto exchanges, and NFT marketplaces are now regulated by the SEC. Which may include guidelines for their registration, licensing, and tax reporting. For investors, it ensures greater transparency and legal protection for their digital investments. </span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How the ISA 2025 Could Impact Music Royalties</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It’s no secret that the process of royalty distribution could be complex. There are quite a few challenges from inefficient collection systems, delayed payments, to poor data tracking. Accurately monetizing streams, downloads, and usage across platforms can be daunting.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, technology is offering ways to fix this, exploring how blockchain can enhance efficiency in royalty distribution.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Tokenizing Music Assets</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The tokenization of music rights is a concept that involves converting ownership of a song or album into tradable digital tokens, each representing a fractional stake in the asset. These tokens can be bought, sold, and used to automate royalty distribution based on token ownership.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">DJ and producer 3LAU (Justin Blau) founded a company called </span><b>Royal.io</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> (not to be confused with </span><a href=\"http://royalti.io\"><b>Royalti.io</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">) that allowed fans the opportunity to purchase Limited Digital Assets (LDAs) tied to streaming royalties. Other platforms like </span><b>Opolous</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> also champion the idea of tokenized music assets.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Additionally, artists can mint exclusive versions of their songs as NFTs and sell them through blockchain-based platforms like </span><b>Catalog</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">,  where collectors can purchase them. </span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Blockchain Technology for Royalty Data</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The potential of blockchain goes beyond tokenization. It can be used to create a unified royalty database capable of accurately tracking streams and downloads in real time. These developments could diversify music income streams and attract new investors into the music space.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Moving Forward: Expectations and Challenges</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">By giving digital assets legal recognition, the ISA 2025 lays the foundation for broader blockchain adoption in music royalty management in Nigeria. It introduces alternative payment avenues, such as crypto-enabled royalty settlements or trading platforms for music rights.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Since these platforms will be regulated by the SEC, the digital assets market is likely to become more stable and investor-friendly. Drawing interest from institutional investors interested in exploring music as an asset class.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Challenges </span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Act provides a legal foundation. However, enforceable standards for the use of digital assets in royalty systems still need to be developed. There is a need to address how digital asset ownership can coexist with existing copyright laws.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There is also a need for education. Enlightening industry players on the potential of digital assets, as the future of music rights and the diversification of royalty streams. This has become imperative, in light of ongoing conversations about the earning disparities between Nigerian artists and their global counterparts.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Widespread adoption will only happen if there’s investment in blockchain infrastructure. Such as databases, smart contracts, secure marketplaces, that support these new models.</span>",

    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The conversation around money is never a simple one, especially in the Nigerian music industry, where the road to transparency in royalty tracking and collection has been long and still far from over. It’s a marathon, not a sprint. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Recently, someone reignited the long-standing debate that music alone might not be enough to sustain an artist in Nigeria. The income from music streaming in Nigeria is barely enough to make a living, and the sheer disparity between what artists earn and what their global counterparts take home from the same platforms cannot be ignored.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So, we decided to stick our noses into the conversation, well, not exactly. We just did a little bit of digging, and now we are sharing the facts we found. The verdict? Well, that’s for you to decide.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Stark Reality of Music Streaming in Nigeria</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A staggering </span><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/spotify-royalty-payouts-nigerian-south-african-artists-boom-2024-2025-04-04/\"><b>₦58 billion</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. That’s how much Nigerian artists earned in 2024 from Spotify alone. Impressive, right? Especially when compared to previous years. I won't lie, when I saw those figures, I had already started making plans: quit job, pursue singing career (heavy emphasis on the “pursue”). After all, Arya Starr doesn’t have two heads. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But before I could get started, Burna Boy shattered my dreams with a single SM post.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">At the heart of the issue is this: Does local popularity equal real income? To put things in perspective, a Nigerian artist might earn around $400 for every million local streams, while an American artist could earn around $4,000 for the same number. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Most point to the difference in </span><a href=\"https://www.spotify.com/ng/premium/\"><b>subscription fees</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. In Nigeria, the average is $0.82, while in the U.S., it’s $11.99. But if local subscription prices are to blame, what about international streams? What about advertising revenue?</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With Nigerian artists featured on over 250 million playlists worldwide, why does their revenue still pale in comparison to their international peers?</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Breaking Down the Streaming Income Gap</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Several factors contribute to the gap in earnings between Nigerian artists and global artists, from subscription fees and ad models to currency valuation and economic realities. So let's start with the most obvious: subscription costs. </span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Subscription Model</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It does not take a genius to figure out that the cost of accessing music streaming in Nigeria plays a huge role in the revenue generated. We compared <strong><a href=\"https://royalti.io/2024/08/spotify-new-royalty-model-streaming-fraud/\">Spotify</a></strong> and Apple Music individual plan prices across six countries: Nigeria, South Africa, South Korea, Brazil, the U.S., and the UK. All amounts were converted to U.S. dollars using April 24, 2025, exchange rates.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nigeria offers the lowest subscription fees, Spotify Premium at roughly $0.81 and Apple Music at $0.62. On the other hand, the UK has the highest $15.95 for Spotify and $14.62 for Apple Music. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The difference? A reflection of economic realities and purchasing power.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But What About Ads?</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Some may argue that free plans are supported by ads and so, even where a large proportion of users rely on the free tiers, there’s the advertising revenue to rely on. But can Nigeria’s digital advertising market be compared to the Western markets? </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And Before you quote the </span><a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/ng/en/publications/entertainment-and-media-outlook.html\"><b>growth projections</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: yes, internet advertising revenue in Nigeria is expected to more than double between 2023 and 2028, with a projected 8.6% annual growth rate in the broader Entertainment &amp; Media sector.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We’ve seen the forecasts, but forecasts are not earnings. Not yet.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And so, while ad-supported streams contribute something to the overall streaming income, it’s not nearly enough to bridge the gap.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Naira vs. Dollar in Music Streaming</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Let’s talk foreign exchange. How does the naira’s decline deepen the revenue disparity?</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In 2021, a ₦900 Spotify subscription translated to about $2.50. Fast-forward to 2025: ₦1300 now converts to roughly $0.82.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The issue isn’t whether Nigerians can pay more to support their favorite artists, because technically, they are. The issue is that the Naira is significantly weaker than most global currencies. And as long as streaming payouts are tied to dollar equivalents, the revenue for Nigerian artists will continue to take a hit.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Add to that the limited disposable income of most Nigerians, and music subscriptions fall even lower on the list of spending priorities. And so, the affordability of these streaming services is such an important factor for wider adoption.  However, lower subscription fees also mean lower payouts for the artists. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And let’s not even start on the cost of data. Have you seen the price of data plans lately? </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">All these directly limit the potential users of streaming platforms,  reducing the ecosystem’s overall earning potential.  </span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fame is Not Always Financial</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Luckily, Afrobeats has already crossed global borders. Its international success could be the ticket to accessing more profitable markets.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There’s a strong local appetite for Nigerian music. But is that enough?</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Streaming platforms rely primarily on subscription income. That means payouts are distributed based on where listeners are and how much they’re paying.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So even if Nigeria had the same number of subscribers as the U.S., the lower fees would still result in significantly less revenue, translating into smaller payouts for Nigerian artists.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So does that mean that to boost their income, artists must expand their reach into markets with higher-paying audiences? The love at home is great, but it doesn’t always pay the bills. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Luckily, Afrobeats has already crossed global borders. Its international success could be the ticket to accessing more profitable markets.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Conclusion</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Despite the economic and industry challenges, Nigerian music remains a powerhouse.  </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Its growing global popularity offers a real opportunity for sustainable growth, even for young, lesser-known talents.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And perhaps, the underlying message is: Global reach equals global revenue potential.</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span></i>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If we ever consider bridging the earning gap, then maybe addressing the underlying economic and infrastructural challenges within Nigeria will be a great place to start.</span>",

    "slug": "the-17th-headies-awards-re-establishing-the-relevance-of-regional-awards-in-nigerias-music-industry",
    "content": "<b>The Headies Awards</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, originally named the Hip Hop World Awards, were established in 2006 to recognize outstanding achievements within the Nigerian music industry. On Sunday, April 27th, 2025, the 17th edition was held at the Landmark Event Center in Lagos. It was a homecoming of sorts, after two consecutive years in Atlanta. The organizers expressed their desire for the Headies to “reclaim” its rightful place of significance and relevance in the Nigerian music scene. Whether or not that goal was achieved remains to be seen. I believe it’s still too early to tell. Let them replant their feet first.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">At <strong><a href=\"https://app.royalti.io/signup?ui=get-started\">Royalti.io</a></strong>, we understand that recognition isn't just symbolic. For instance, receiving a Daesang at MAMA Asia is more than a regional milestone. It’s a signal to global gatekeepers, DSPs, and investors that these artists are forces to be reckoned with. Despite the criticisms it faces, that is the vision behind the Headies. To serve as a barometer of Nigeria's vibrant music industry.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This piece is not intended to assess how the Headies may or may not have met their objective. Instead, it’s about the importance of representation, creating a platform that acknowledges and celebrates the full scope of Nigerian music. A platform that doesn’t just claim inclusivity but earns that recognition by truly reflecting the diversity of Nigerian music. </span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Why Regional Music Awards Matter More Than Ever</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the wake of the 17th edition of the Headies, it’s worth asking why regions and countries choose to host their own music award shows. Perhaps it stems from a need to celebrate their unique sounds and elevate artists by increasing the value of their music catalogs.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It's easy to undervalue regional awards, especially when compared to global honors like the Grammys. But that perception is flawed. Local recognition is built on an appreciation for diversity, cultural resonance, and visibility. Increasingly, regional accolades are reshaping how artists gain influence, negotiate contracts, and unlock greater value from their work.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A Stage That Understands the Sound</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Global awards may offer prestige, but they rarely reflect the full range of global music. Regional shows like The Headies in Nigeria, the South African Music Awards (SAMAs), or the Mnet Asian Music Awards (MAMA) give artists the validation that resonates with their core audiences. These platforms are rooted in local language, sound, and identity, allowing artists to be celebrated on their own terms. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Take the MAMA Awards</span><b>,</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> which originally launched in South Korea in 1999 as a local event. It has since grown into a pan-Asian celebration of music, playing a central role in the global expansion of K-pop and helping acts like BTS, TWICE, and EXO cement their global reach.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For emerging talent, recognition from those who understand their journey can carry more weight than international acclaim, which often comes later in their careers. The Headies’ “Next Rated” category is a good example; it has served as a springboard for some of Nigeria’s biggest stars.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Beyond Recognition: Royalty Implications and Business Leverage</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Although winning an award is emotionally gratifying, it is also a strategic asset. What better validation of your work than acknowledgment from your peers? The visibility and credibility gained from an award can be leveraged for real business value. Even a nomination signals creativity and professional growth.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">An award win can boost streaming numbers thanks to exposure and algorithmic placement. It can justify better terms in licensing and distribution deals and give artists stronger bargaining power when negotiating with labels and DSPs. It also opens doors to endorsements and brand partnerships.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ultimately, regional awards build credibility where it matters most: at home. And once you’ve dominated your local scene, reaching a global audience becomes much more attainable.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Conclusion</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Artists are no longer waiting for international validation. The rise of regional music awards like The Headies and MAMA Asia reflects a shift: artists now leverage award wins as a launchpad for global success.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As the Headies work to re-establish their relevance, concerns remain about their representation of Nigeria’s diverse music culture and the adequacy of their planning. Still, we see that there is a space to be filled. A vital role to play in shaping careers and showcasing Nigerian talent on the global stage. Regional awards matter, and the Headies have an opportunity to rise to the occasion.</span>",

    "title": "A Decade of Rhythm: Nigerian Music in the 2000s",
    "slug": "a-decade-of-rhythm-nigerian-music-in-the-2000s",
    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The decade marked a defining era of hip-hop and RnB on the Nigerian music mainstream, filled with rhythmic bangers and lyrics children had no business singing out loud. The 2000s were an exciting time for Nigerian music. There was a wave of new artists, young, eager, and ready to make a name for themselves. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What was a party without Olu Maintain's \"Yahooze\" or a club scene in a Nollywood movie without 9ice's \"Gongo Aso\"? The sounds were daring and diverse, some tracks were upbeat, others soulful or groovy. </span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Dawn of New Sounds</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The 2000s were a free-for-all in sonic experimentation. Nigerian artists boldly blended genres in ways that had rarely been done before. Albums could feature everything from highlife to hip-hop, RnB to reggae, and even traditional folk laced with electronic beats, all in one project. Not like the audience minded, anyway. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Styl-Plus’ album </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Expressions</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> (2006) is a good example. The album hopped between boy band-style harmonies, Nigerian storytelling, gospel-tinged ballads, and understated hip hop beats. Similarly, P-Square's </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Get Squared </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(2005) album merged  American RnB and hip hop arrangements but also included tracks with Igbo lyrics.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A symphony of genres</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Although some of these songs were inspired by Western music styles, Nigerian artists weren’t copycats. In pure Nigerian fashion, they found a new identity, infusing tradition with innovation. Take Lagbaja’s Afro jazz style or P-Square’s interesting experimentation of club-ready dance beats with hip-hop, and RnB while offering renditions in Igbo. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In a sense, this was the era we began moving towards creating a fusion of Western trends that resonated deeply at home and increasingly across Africa. The musical buffet included everything: boy bands, solo acts, pop, rap, afro-pop, Afrobeats, soul, gospel, you name it, we had it.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nigerian Music Industry: A Budding Ecosystem</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A lot of record labels sprang up right around the late ‘90s and early 2000s, a testament that the Nigerian music industry was blooming. These labels helped to launch the careers of many of our all-time favorites. A few are highlighted below:</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Kennis Music (Founded in 1998)</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Founded by Kehinde \"Kenny\" Ogungbe and Dayo \"D1\" Adeneye. Kennis released music in predominantly Afrobeats, RnB, hip-hop, and pop genres. The artists’ repertoire included 2Face Idibia, Eedris Abdulkareem, Sound Sultan, and Tony Tetuila.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Mo' Hits Records (Founded in 2004)</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Co-founded by Don Jazzy and D'banj, Mo’Hits became well known for Afrobeats and hip hop. D'banj was its first breakout star, followed by Wande Coal, Dr SID, D'Prince, Kayswitch, and many more.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The label dissolved in 2012, leading Don Jazzy to establish Mavin Records.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Storm Records (Active in the 2000s)</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Though founded by Obi Asika in the ‘90s, it wasn’t until the 2000s that its signees became mainstream. It delivered hip-hop, RnB, and pop hits from talents like Naeto C, Sasha P, Ikechukwu, and Tosin Martins.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Chocolate City (Founded in 2005)</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Founded by Audu Maikori, Paul Okeugo, and Yahaya Maikori. During this period, the label was known for its hip-hop, RnB, and Afrobeats roster, M.I. Abaga, Ice Prince, Jesse Jagz, Brymo, Victoria Kimani, and Dice Ailes.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Square Records (Founded in 2001)</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This label was launched by P-Square (Peter &amp; Paul Okoye) and managed by their brother, Jude Okoye. Square Records was one of Nigeria’s earliest major artist-owned labels. You could say it influenced a wave of independent music entrepreneurship in Nigeria.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And then there were the producers, standing behind every beat and every hit, shaping an ecosystem that boasts a rich, diverse music history. From Mo’ Hits to Mavin Records, Don Jazzy is an undeniable figure in the evolution of 2000s Nigerian music. There’s also OJB Jezreel with 2Baba’s 2004 album Face-2-face, I mean, does “African Queen” need further introduction? And Cobhams Asuquo with Asa, Sasha P, and Djinee. These are the Influential figures that helped mold the early 2000s Nigerian hip-hop, RnB, and gospel. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We could go on and on, about a decade of explosive creativity, unforgettable albums, mad beats, but we’ll let the music speak for itself.

    "title": "TikTok Made Me Famous: How Social Media Is Shaping the Careers of Music Stars",
    "slug": "tiktok-made-me-famous-how-social-media-is-shaping-the-careers-of-music-stars",
    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Social media has had an indisputable hand in shaping pop culture for a while now. It influences trends and drives popular conversations, not just what’s hot and trendy, but also around social issues, economic upheaval, and political climates. Social media is no longer just an abstract universe on the World Wide Web. It’s steadily asserting itself as a cultural and economic force to be reckoned with.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Does this unstoppable wave have the power to make the ordinary famous? Can it turn a modern-day Cinderella into the belle of the ball? </span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The TikTok Fame Factory: Has Social Media Become the Music Industry’s Front Door?</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I think at its core, social media was built from a need to enhance human connection, free from the limits of time, class, or geographical location. At least, that’s how it began.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But over time, social media has slowly developed a life of its own. The internet offers vast opportunities, endless knowledge, and unlimited resources. Telecommunication devices deliver connectivity and access.  Social media? It provides the stage. A hub. A digital arena where where visibility is currency. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For a while now,  platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube have altered how music is discovered. They’ve created a pathway where overnight success is no longer rare, and where even the biggest artists now align their strategies to social media dynamics. </span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">From Nobody to Notable</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A single viral video can be the difference between an ordinary Tuesday and instant fame. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Social media platforms, especially those centered around short-form video content, have created an ecosystem that disrupted traditional gatekeeping in the music industry. By introducing artists straight to their audiences, they’ve become a starting point for social media music careers.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Social Media Success Stories: The Artists Who Went Viral</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If we are talking receipts, many artists can point to social media as being instrumental for their breakout moments. </span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lil Nas X’s Old Town Road became the soundtrack for a viral challenge and turned into a global hit, earning him a record deal and stardom. </span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">CKay's Love Nwantiti went international, thanks largely to its popularity on TikTok and Instagram. </span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Doja Cat’s song Say So went viral on TikTok, and the dance choreographed by a TikTok user became so popular that parts of it were incorporated into the official music video. </span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Tyla's Water followed a similar path, lifted by a viral dance challenge created for the track. </span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Olivia Rodrigo was already known for her Disney roles, but transitioned to global sensation when her song </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Driver's License</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> took off on social media. </span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Conan Gray built a solid following on TikTok before launching his debut album. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Is There a Formula for Music Fame?</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So does fame have a formula now? In some ways, yes. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">According to the </span><a href=\"https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-and-luminate-release-latest-music-impact-report\"><b>Music Impact Report</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> for 2024, the fastest route to the Billboard Global 200 was TikTok virality.  In fact, TikTok users are 74% more likely than average social media users to discover and share new music.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Analysing viral content, and perhaps you’ll see that there is a pattern:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Catchy hooks that fit well in short clips. </span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Relatable or emotionally resonant lyrics </span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Association with trends or challenges. </span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">High participation potential from users</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It won't hurt to have a unique personality or compelling backstory. A mix of these, and you’re well-positioned for viral appeal.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The New Rules of the Game</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The impact of social media on the music industry is telling. Everything from talent scouting to marketing and distribution has shifted to reflect these realities. Record labels seek out artists with an existing online presence.  Songs are being tailored for the algorithm: shorter durations, catchy intros, and content-friendly hooks. In a previous post, we talked about </span><a href=\"https://royalti.io/2024/10/social-media-banter-the-strategic-power-of-controversy/\"><b>how artists and songwriters are adjusting their creative processes to fit this format</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. The era of 15-track albums is giving way to singles designed for maximum TikTok traction. </span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Algorithm Behind the Fame</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Each social platform has its own algorithm, but the goal is the same: keep users engaged by serving them content they’re likely to enjoy.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">TikTok’s algorithm analyzes a mix of data:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">User activity (likes, comments, shares, watch time)</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Video info (captions, audio, hashtags)</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Device and account settings</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Trending sounds and strategic hashtags increase visibility and push content beyond a creator’s immediate followers. TikTok's \"Add to Music App\" feature bridges the gap between on-platform discovery and off-platform streams.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So What Does This Mean for Artists?</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Alongside talent, an artist needs visibility, engagement, and strategy to thrive.  In learning to string their guitars, they must also:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Cultivate active social media pages</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Engage directly with fans</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Build a loyal community</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Think like a creator and a brand</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Social media has widened the door into the industry and leveled the playing field in some ways. But to truly succeed, artists must blend authentic creativity with smart digital strategy. Those who strike this balance are the ones who turn followers into fans and build lasting music careers both on and off social media in the process.</span>",

    "content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">From a distinct sound in West Africa to a global music powerhouse, Afrobeats have undergone a remarkable transformation. Once a vibrant yet localized expression, it has evolved into a dominant cultural force that showcases the richness and complexity of African identity. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you’ve been following our series, “</span><a href=\"https://royalti.io/2024/12/a-decade-of-rhythm-nigerian-music-in-the-70s/\"><b>A Decade of Rhythms</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">,” which chronicles the history of Nigerian mainstream music, then this post will feel all too familiar.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Afrobeats: A Product of Innovation</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Afrobeats emerged from a spirit of curiosity and experimentation. A fusion of rhythms indigenous to West Africa with Western genres like jazz and funk, and eventually expanding to embrace elements of blues, hip hop, and pop. What began as an organic blend has since matured into a continually evolving genre.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Long before the beloved Fela Kuti, there was a sound that was already thriving across Ghana, Nigeria, and neighboring countries. It was a sound rooted in percussion, flutes, and other locally crafted instruments. Early West African music varied by region, but was familiar. It was at its core celebratory, wrapped in storytelling and dance.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Afrobeats was born from this sound. Unbound by convention, it seamlessly morphed into numerous sub-genres across the continent, with each generation contributing new textures, rhythms, and ideas.</span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A Sound of Resistance and Expression</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nigerian multi-instrumentalist Fela Kuti’s music evolved in the ‘70s. His unique blend of jazz, funk, and traditional Yoruba rhythms, what he called \"Afrobeat,\" became a vehicle for socio-political commentary. Through his lyrics, Fela took aim at government corruption and social injustice, drawing both national admiration and relentless state persecution. He was arrested over 200 times. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Later, artists like Shina Peters and Sunny Okosun brought their own interpretations to the Afrobeat sound, helping to embed it into the cultural mainstream.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Afrobeats Goes Global</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The popularity of Afrobeats did not wane even after Fela’s passing in the ‘90s. Evolving into a broader, more eclectic soundscape. For years, its appeal remained largely regional. But everything changed in the 2010s.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With the influx of digital streaming platforms, the sound and the talents behind it were exposed to global audiences like never before.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Far from the political lyrics of Fela's songs, the 2010s were more focused on creating universally appealing, danceable tracks. It wasn’t long before the milestones started rolling in. In 2011, D'banj's \"Oliver Twist\" became the first Nigerian song to crack the UK Singles Chart, peaking at </span><a href=\"https://thenollywoodreporter.com/news/dbanj-2baba-and-psquare-battle-in-a-poll-and-nigerians-choose/\"><b>number 9</b></a><b>.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Then Wizkid's collaboration with Drake on \"One Dance\" in 2016 proved to be a catalyst, making him the first Nigerian artist to chart on and top the Billboard Hot 100. The rest, they say, is history. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Between 2017 and 2022, Afrobeats streams on Spotify grew by 550%, culminating in more than 13 billion streams in 2022 alone. On social media, songs like CKay's \"Love Nwantiti\" peaked in user engagement, inspiring viral dance challenges on platforms like TikTok.</span>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Collaborations That Changed Everything</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One could argue that International collaborations were the secret weapon for Afrobeats' global rise, citing songs like Ed Sheeran's remix of Fireboy's \"Peru\" or Justin Bieber's remix of Wizkid and Tems' \"Essence\". While these collaborations indeed accelerated global breakthroughs, the songs were already successful in their own right. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\"Peru\" topped the UK’s </span><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-60147212\"><b>Official Afrobeats Charts</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> for four weeks and reached 75 million streams pre-remix. Similarly, \"Essence\" was the first Nigerian song to appear on the Billboard Hot 100 before Bieber's feature, and ultimately peaked at No. 9, becoming the most Shazamed song in the USA at the time.. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Global recognition manifested through prestigious awards and dedicated categories. The American Music Awards, the Grammys, and the MTV VMAs have all added Afrobeats categories to their rosters in recent years. </span>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So, Why Now?</span></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Several factors contributed to the rise of Afrobeats internationally:</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Digital Accessibility </span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The existence of global streaming services like Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube has eliminated geographical barriers, allowing artists to reach millions with the click of a button. Social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram have amplified this effect, with viral dance challenges and snippets of songs being tools used to introduce Afrobeats to younger audiences.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Innovative Sound and Catchy Rhythms</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">At its core, Afrobeats is rhythm-driven and danceable. Its vibrant melodies are steeped in West African musical traditions yet packaged with modern production techniques, appealing to listeners regardless of language.</span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Strategic Collaborations</span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As stated earlier, collaborations have been instrumental in the popularity of Afrobeats. Artists like Burna Boy, Wizkid, Davido, Tems, and Rema have strategically collaborated with international artists such as Drake, Beyoncé, Ed Sheeran, and Selena Gomez. </span>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Cultural Resonance </span></h4>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For the increasing number of Africans in diaspora, Afrobeats represents home. The language, storytelling, and fashion embedded in the music evoke feelings of nostalgia. It’s more than sound, it is identity. And increasingly, this authenticity resonates with audiences around the world.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We’ve certainly come a long way from Fela's resistance anthems in the ‘60s and ‘70s. The influence of Afrobeats now extends beyond music to fashion, food, and even language. A sound that has evolved into one of Africa's most powerful cultural exports. </span>",
